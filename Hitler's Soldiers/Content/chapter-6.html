<!-- IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS -->
<!--- section-1 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-1">1. Expansion of the Reich's Empire</span>
<p>
    In 1940, Germany rapidly expanded its control over western and northwest Europe, significantly enlarging its empire. This expansion was not uniform in its impact on the occupied territories; the experiences of the conquered peoples varied greatly, primarily due to Nazi racial ideology. This ideology ranked populations in a racial hierarchy, influencing the nature of their occupation.
</p>
<p>
    For instance, Denmark and Norway, regarded as "Germanic" populations, faced a comparatively benign occupation, contrasting sharply with the brutal treatment meted out to Poland. An account from Private Willi F. of the 198th Infantry Division highlighted Denmark as a land of abundance, noting the friendly and clean nature of the locals, and the stark difference in treatment compared to the situation in Poland.
</p>
<!--- section-2 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-2">2. Variation in Treatment Based on Nazi Ideology</span>
<p>
    The Nazi regime's view of the newly occupied territories in western Europe was largely exploitative, devoid of any genuine interest in economic or political partnership. Hitler's focus was on exploiting these areas for the Reich's benefit. This was reflected in the occupation policies, which varied depending on the perceived racial status of the populations. The treatment of western European countries was less severe than that of Eastern Europe, particularly Poland, due to their higher standing in the Nazi racial hierarchy.
</p>
<!--- section-3 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-3">3. German Army's Role in Occupation</span>
<p>
    The German army's involvement in the occupation differed across various territories, influenced by Hitler and the Nazi leadership's perceptions. Initially, the army's behavior in the West was regulated by the "Guidelines for Service of the Troops in Occupied Areas," which dictated a disciplined and restrained conduct towards civilians. These guidelines aimed to present the German soldier as a representative of the German people, emphasizing honorable behavior, restraint, and honesty in dealings.
</p>
<!--- section-4 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-4">4. Discipline and Behavior Guidelines for Troops</span>
<p>
    Field Marshal von Brauchitsch's issuance of the guidelines on troop behavior in occupied areas highlighted a distinct approach to the Western territories compared to Eastern Europe. These guidelines stressed discipline, honorable conduct, and restraint, especially towards the civilian population. This approach underscored the German army's recognition of the difference in treatment warranted by the varying perceived racial status of the occupied peoples.

<!--- section-5 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-5">5. Conflicting Agendas between Military and Economic Agencies</span>
<p>
    The agendas of military governors and central economic agencies diverged significantly, with both sides aiming to exploit occupied territories. Military governors, concerned primarily with the needs of the military in these areas, sought to avoid unnecessary exploitation to maintain long-term viability. In contrast, G?ring's economic goals were more acquisitive, focused on meeting the central needs of Germany's war economy. This clash led to tensions and a complex balance between exploiting resources and maintaining a semblance of order and cooperation within the occupied territories.
</p>
<!--- section-6 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-6">6. Role of Military Governors in Economic Exploitation</span>
<p>
    Military governors, while not as aggressively acquisitive as some Nazi leaders, nonetheless played a significant role in the economic exploitation of occupied territories. Their approach, aimed at satisfying the economic needs of the military, sometimes conflicted with the broader Nazi agenda and even with Wehrmacht field commanders who were more inclined to plunder. The pragmatic nature of military governors, coupled with their lack of political ambition and limited personnel, led to a reliance on cooperative native administrations. These administrations varied in their enthusiasm for the Nazi 'New Order,' with some motivated by opportunism or a pragmatic acknowledgment of German control.
</p>
<!--- section-7 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-7">7. Interaction between German Soldiers and Civilian Population</span>
<p>
    The interaction between German soldiers and the civilian population in occupied territories varied from cool detachment to relative conviviality. In Belgium, for instance, General von Falkenhausen's relatively lenient treatment of the population, driven by his private criticism of the Nazi regime, contributed to a more bearable occupation experience, especially when compared to the First World War. This nuanced relationship was also evident in the economic and political ambitions of administrators like Reeder in Belgium, who sought to transform the economic and political structure into a more corporatist, technocratic state.
</p>
<!--- section-8 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-8">8. The Nuanced Relationship between Occupier and Occupied in France</span>
<p>
    Occupied France presents a prime example of the complex dynamics between occupier and occupied. The early years of occupation were marked by a considerable degree of give-and-take, with French administrative officials relying on German authority to enforce occupation rules. Despite potential conflicts of interest, the process often involved negotiation and compromise. The age and outlook of German military administrators, many of whom had personal memories of France's efforts during the First World War, contributed to a more respectful and broad-minded approach to the occupation. This, combined with the personality of individual German administrators, played a significant role in shaping the local occupation regime, influencing the nature of interactions between German soldiers and French civilians.

<!--- section-9 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-9">9. German-French Civilian Relations</span>
<p>
    Relations between German soldiers and French civilians were complex, influenced by the physical setting and individual interactions. In rural areas, personal connections sometimes softened the occupier-occupied dynamic, as recounted by Breton novelist Louis Guilloux. However, in urban centers like Paris, the relationship was more impersonal and often marked by mutual disregard, with French civilians trying to ignore the occupying forces. Despite instances of cordiality, the French were frequently reminded of their subjugated status through minor humiliations imposed by German soldiers, underscoring the prevailing tension and lack of genuine goodwill between the occupiers and the occupied.
</p>
<!--- section-10 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-10">10. Sexual Exploitation and Shopping Spree by German Soldiers</span>
<p>
    The early months of the occupation saw a surge in sexual encounters between German soldiers and French civilians, ranging from consensual relationships to coercion and exploitation. The establishment of Wehrmacht-run brothels was a controversial attempt to regulate such interactions and prevent sexually transmitted diseases, albeit with underlying coercion of women already in prostitution. Concurrently, German soldiers engaged in rampant consumerism, indulging in shopping sprees that depleted French stores of their goods, reflecting the soldiers' desire to capitalize on their victorious status and the availability of consumer goods, further straining Franco-German relations.
</p>
<!--- section-11 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-11">11. Economic Requisition and Its Effects</span>
<p>
    German occupation forces implemented extensive requisitioning programs to exploit the French economy for the war effort, justified under the broad interpretation of "military necessity." This led to the seizure of raw materials and consumer goods, significantly impacting the local economy and contributing to social resentment. The Central Purchasing Office played a pivotal role in this exploitation, intensifying the economic strain on occupied territories and highlighting the conflict between German military and economic objectives and the well-being of the local population.
</p>
<!--- section-12 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-12">12. The Black Market and Inflation</span>
<p>
    The economic strain and shortages caused by German requisitioning and exploitation gave rise to a thriving black market in occupied France. German soldiers, despite being among the black market's primary patrons, were involved in efforts to crack down on it, highlighting the hypocrisy within the occupation authorities. The inflation driven by German policies, including the demand that occupied territories bear the costs of their own occupation, further destabilized the local economies, contributing to the hardships faced by civilians and fostering resentment towards the occupiers.
</p>

    [Pages 9-12]
</p>
<!--- section-13 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-13">13. Slow Development of Resistance</span>
<p>
    Resistance to German occupation in Western Europe was initially slow to develop due to several factors. Denmark and Norway, lacking a tradition of resistance against foreign occupiers, and the urbanized societies of France and Belgium not conducive to guerrilla warfare, contributed to this slow emergence. Most civilians chose to adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude, tolerating the austere but bearable conditions under German control. Sporadic resentment and embryonic resistance were visible, but large-scale uprisings were considered impractical due to a lack of resources and effective support from external allies like Britain.
</p>
<!--- section-14 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-14">14. Initial Responses to Resistance</span>
<p>
    The German military's approach to emerging resistance was generally measured, aiming not to provoke widespread heroism among the masses. Incidents of resistance were often treated with leniency, with efforts focused on deterrents rather than harsh retaliations. This cautious approach was evident in instances where German authorities opted for less provocative measures, such as avoiding the confiscation of radios to prevent people from listening to the BBC, and implementing death penalties for severe offences as a deterrent rather than a regular punitive measure.
</p>
<!--- section-15 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-15">15. The Start of Anti-Semitic Measures</span>
<p>
    The early days of occupation saw the beginning of anti-Semitic measures, particularly in France. The German occupation authorities started with measures that seemed relatively restrained but set the stage for more severe persecution. The Madagascar Plan, which proposed relocating European Jews to Madagascar, spurred Nazi agencies to expedite the persecution and eventual removal of Jews from occupied territories, despite the logistical and practical challenges associated with the plan.
</p>
<!--- section-16 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-16">16. Escalation of Anti-Jewish Policies</span>
<p>
    As the occupation progressed, anti-Jewish policies escalated, particularly with the involvement of the Einsatzstab Rosenberg, tasked with repossessing property allegedly stolen by Jews. This led to a more systemic approach to the persecution of Jews, involving the registration of Jewish businesses and their eventual takeover. The German military government, along with Vichy France, began implementing measures to eliminate Jews from economic positions of power, sharing responsibility with French authorities to enforce these anti-Semitic policies.
