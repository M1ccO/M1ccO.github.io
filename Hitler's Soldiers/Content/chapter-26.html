<span class="subheading-text" id="section-1">1. # The Third Reich's Military Power and Public Fascination</span>
<p>
    The Third Reich, led by Adolf Hitler, remains a potent source of public and media fascination, with images of Nazi rallies at Nuremberg continuing to captivate and horrify. The grand displays of military might, featuring Nazi troops and weaponry orchestrated in vast torch-lit arenas, aimed to inspire the German people while intimidating opponents. These displays were widely broadcast through newspapers and newsreels during the 1930s, offering a glimpse of Nazi Germany's formidable war machine .
</p>
<p>
    For many, these spectacles evoked a sense of impending danger as Germany began its aggressive expansion in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The Wehrmacht, Germany's armed forces, achieved significant conquests during this period, and the German army, in particular, played a central role. The army was often viewed as the primary weapon of the Third Reich, led by Hitler, with its ideology deeply rooted in militarism and nationalistic pride. This focus on militaristic power and expansion served to fuel the fear and concern of neighboring nations .
</p>
<!--- section-2 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-2">2. Hitler's Background and the Development of Nazi Ideology</span>
<p>
    Adolf Hitler's early life experiences significantly shaped his later ideology and militarism. Born in Austria, he lived as a struggling artist-cum-drifter in Vienna between 1908 and 1913. His service as a soldier in the Royal Bavarian Army on the Western Front from 1914 to 1918 further radicalized his worldview. Germany's defeat in World War I, along with the political chaos and humiliation of the Treaty of Versailles, laid the foundation for Hitler's extreme nationalism and racial beliefs .
</p>
<p>
    In 1919, Hitler joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), which was later renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). He rapidly ascended to the party's leadership, becoming its chairman in 1921. Hitler's writings and speeches during the 1920s reflected a common belief that Germany's loss in World War I was due to a "stab in the back" by civilian leaders, Communists, and Jews. This belief underpinned his aggressive expansionist ideology, with war seen as a means to restore Germany's territorial integrity and bolster the German race. He viewed war as necessary not only to reclaim lost territory but also to strengthen the German people in a world characterized by perpetual struggle for dominance .
</p>

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-3">3. Hitler's Rise to Power and the Expansionist Agenda</span>
<p>
    The late 1920s and early 1930s saw Germany plunge into political and economic turmoil, providing Hitler and the Nazis with an opportunity to gain power. The Nazis garnered significant support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles, appealing to Germans' economic grievances, and promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism, and anti-Communism. As the Weimar Republic struggled, Hitler's influence grew, leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933 and then as national leader (Führer) in 1934 .
</p>
<p>
    During the late 1930s, Germany's expansionist ambitions became increasingly apparent. Hitler orchestrated the annexation of Austria and much of Czechoslovakia, raising international concern and condemnation, but without immediate military consequences. However, the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, led Britain, France, and the British Commonwealth to declare war on Germany, marking the beginning of World War II. This aggressive expansion was driven by Hitler's belief in the necessity of war to expand German territory and secure the nation's future .
</p>
<!--- section-4 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-4">4. The German Army's Successes and their Implications</span>
<p>
    The German army's early successes during World War II contributed to its reputation as the most effective fighting force in modern European warfare. The Wehrmacht's victories over France, Britain, and their allies in 1940 demonstrated its tactical and operational prowess, achieving in six weeks what the German army had failed to accomplish during four years of World War I. The army's swift conquest of France and its successful advances in the Soviet Union in 1941 further solidified its formidable reputation .
</p>
<p>
    The high point of the German army's achievements was attributed to several factors, including the self-sacrifice and valour of German soldiers and the ability of commanders at all levels to think and act independently. However, these early triumphs masked underlying weaknesses in the German army's structure and organization, as well as logistical and strategic issues. Additionally, the chaotic high-command structure imposed by Hitler and the German generals' disregard for logistics and intelligence ultimately contributed to the army's eventual decline .

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-5">5. Post-War Perspective and the German Army's Role in the Cold War</span>
<p>
    After the collapse of the Third Reich in 1945, the German army's image underwent significant transformation. During the Cold War, both German-speaking and English-speaking scholars often eulogized the German army, seeing it as an ally to NATO and a successor to the Bundeswehr, the federal army of West Germany. Former German generals, who had experience fighting in the Soviet Union, often portrayed the German army as a highly skilled force capable of overcoming adversities. This perspective appealed to Western audiences, especially NATO planners who faced the potential threat of a conventional war with the numerically superior forces of the Warsaw Pact .
</p>
<p>
    However, this portrayal was partly influenced by the Cold War context, which created a favorable narrative for Western interests. Former German generals conveyed the idea that quality could prevail against quantity, a reassuring message for those concerned about the overwhelming strength of Soviet forces. The end of the Cold War provided scholars with new opportunities to access a wealth of material from the former Soviet bloc, leading to a more detailed and objective examination of the German army's performance during World War II .
</p>
<!--- section-6 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-6">6. Deconstructing the Myth of the "Clean Wehrmacht"</span>
<p>
    The post-war image of the German army often depicted its members as honorable soldiers who fought for their country out of patriotic duty, distinct from the Nazi regime's crimes. This perspective was challenged in the 1960s when West German scholars began to question the "clean Wehrmacht" narrative. The surge in scholarship, aided by new archival sources, led to the deconstruction of this myth. It became clear that the German army was complicit in many of the Third Reich's atrocities, and its image as a body of men aloof from Nazi fanaticism was largely a fabrication .
</p>
<p>
    The German army's alignment with Nazi ideology was not limited to a few bad actors. Instead, the army itself became permeated with Nazi beliefs due to a mixture of utilitarian calculation, ruthless military attitudes, and brutalizing circumstances. This harsh reality forced scholars to examine why some soldiers, units, and higher commands were more complicit in Nazi crimes than others, raising broader questions about the conduct and morality of the German army under the Third Reich .
</p>
<!--- section-7 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-7">7. The Prussian Officer Corps and Its Role in Nazi Germany</span>
<p>
    The officer corps of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918 was dominated by the highly conservative Prussian officer corps. This corps was composed primarily of the aristocratic and landowning Junker class, with deep roots in the lands east of the River Elbe. The ethos of this officer corps emphasized unquestioning loyalty to the state and disengagement from the complexities of German politics and society. This environment made officers more distrustful of any group outside the conservative nationalist mainstream, often reinforcing anti-Semitic and anti-socialist sentiments .
</p>
<p>
    Despite this conservative background, the officer corps underwent some modernization, acknowledging the need for technical proficiency in a modern mass army. However, it remained fixated on the narrow business of soldiering, focusing on tactics and operations rather than broader strategic considerations. This myopic approach to soldiering contributed to Germany's acute strategic weaknesses during both world wars, with the officer corps believing its superior tactical and operational performance could overcome these shortcomings .
</p>
<!--- section-8 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-8">8. The Impact of World War I on the German Officer Corps</span>
<p>
    The impact of World War I had a profound effect on the German officer corps, especially those who experienced the industrial-scale carnage on the western front. The officer corps drew broader and often harsh conclusions about how future wars should be fought, emphasizing the mobilization of all available resources, including civilian populations, to achieve victory. This perspective contributed to the rise of the Third Reich's all-encompassing approach to industrialized warfare and reinforced the ruthless attitudes within the army .
</p>
<p>
    Officers holding senior command positions in the Third Reich came from two generations: the older generation, born primarily during the 1870s and 1880s, and the Frontkämpfergeneration, born during the 1890s. Both groups were hardened by their experiences during World War I, with the latter experiencing the front lines firsthand. This hardening effect, combined with a fixation on soldiering, contributed to the officer corps' complicity in Nazi ideology and their willingness to align with the regime.
</p>

</p>
<!--- section-9 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-9">9. Anti-Russian Sentiments and World War I's Impact on German Society</span>
<p>
    The German high command's fears of Russian expansion and anti-Russian sentiments played a significant role in propelling Germany into World War I in 1914. These sentiments were further inflamed by the atrocities committed by the Russian army during its brief invasion of East Prussia in August 1914. Many German officers experienced the "primitive" conditions of western Russia through violent encounters during the war, further cementing their negative perceptions of the Russian state .
</p>
<p>
    Following the armistice in November 1918, many officers who would eventually form the leadership of Hitler's army believed that the Kaiser’s army was undermined by defeatism spread by seditious groups on the home front. This belief was rooted in the "stab in the back" myth, a potent narrative that blamed Germany's defeat on civilian leaders and other groups, while overlooking the fact that Germany's civilian population had lost faith in the army's ability to continue the war. The aftermath of the war saw violent upheavals and left-wing revolts in Germany, which the new Social Democrat-led government had to suppress with the aid of the army and right-wing vigilante groups like the Freikorps. This period deepened anti-Semitic and anti-socialist prejudices among army officers, who associated Jews with the far left .
</p>
<!--- section-10 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-10">10. The Treaty of Versailles and Its Impacts on Post-War Germany</span>
<p>
    The Treaty of Versailles, imposed on Germany in 1919, caused significant resentment among German officers and the general population. The treaty imposed massive financial reparations, reduced Germany's land mass, demilitarized the Rhineland, stripped Germany of its overseas colonies, and held Germany responsible for causing the war. For the army, the treaty's most galling provisions included reducing the army to a small 100,000-man force, disbanding the elite General Staff, and ceding much of the traditional Junker officer class's land to the newly created state of Poland or cutting it off from the rest of Germany through the "Polish Corridor" .
</p>
<p>
    The leadership of the Reichswehr, the reduced German army, sought to circumvent these constraints and looked forward to a time when Germany could rearm and reclaim its power on the international stage. This involved secretive planning and collaboration with the Red Army of the Soviet Union to train and develop military capabilities, even as Germany's position on the world stage remained precarious. The Reichswehr leadership was determined to ensure that Germany would be able to wage successful military campaigns in the future, despite the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles .
</p>
<!--- section-11 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-11">11. The Reichswehr's Strategy and Its Secret Collaboration with the Red Army</span>
<p>
    To circumvent the Versailles Treaty, the Reichswehr adopted a three-pronged strategy to prepare for a future rearmament. The first prong focused on developing new tactics and weaponry, as well as creating concepts for successful military operations. The Reichswehr established a clandestine armored-warfare training school in collaboration with the Soviet Union's Red Army, pooling expertise and resources to mutual benefit .
</p>
<p>
    This secret collaboration was crucial for the Reichswehr to circumvent the treaty's armaments provisions while gaining valuable experience in armored warfare. Despite being seemingly unlikely partners, the Reichswehr and the Red Army shared common ground as nations considered international lepers during the 1920s. This covert training and development of armaments allowed the Reichswehr to maintain a level of tactical and technical proficiency unmatched by any other army of the period .
</p>
<!--- section-12 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-12">12. The Development of Armored Warfare and Tactical Innovations</span>
<p>
    The Reichswehr's strategy involved building a smaller, more socially selective officer corps, aiming to transform it into a professional elite. The drastic reduction in the size of the German army allowed for this streamlining, resulting in a corps that was technically proficient and highly trained. The Reichswehr's emphasis on armored warfare and innovative tactics set the stage for its future successes. This included utilizing storm-troop tactics, which involved independently operating squads equipped with light artillery, machine guns, grenades, and flamethrowers .
</p>
<p>
    These tactics were originally developed during World War I and proved effective in restoring movement to the battlefield. However, they failed to achieve decisive victories in the Western Front in 1918. Nonetheless, the Reichswehr's armored warfare specialists believed that replacing storm troops with tanks (Panzers), combined with air power and other branches, could lead to rapid and decisive victories in future conflicts. The Reichswehr's strategy also included promoting "Auftragstaktik," or "mission tactics," which emphasized the independence and flexibility of subordinate commanders while ensuring adherence to the broader operational goals
</p>

<!--- section-13 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-13">13. Defensive Warfare and Auftragstaktik's Application in the Reichswehr</span>
<p>
    The concept of "Auftragstaktik," or "mission tactics," played a central role in the Reichswehr's doctrine, emphasizing flexibility and independent decision-making among officers. This approach allowed commanders to adapt to rapidly changing battlefield conditions while adhering to broader strategic objectives. Defensive warfare, a critical aspect of the Reichswehr's strategy, involved delayed resistance, effectively a fighting retreat that took advantage of the army's manoeuvrability and flexibility to engage and withdraw strategically .
</p>
<p>
    General Hermann von François, a corps commander during the German Eighth Army's defense against the Russian invasion of East Prussia in 1914, exemplified the concept of Auftragstaktik. He displayed a mix of recklessness and ingenuity, managing to ruin an initial plan but later playing a crucial role in annihilating the Russian Second Army. This approach to defensive warfare was intended to compensate for the Reichswehr's numerical weakness by allowing troops to use mobility and tactical adaptability to their advantage .
</p>
<!--- section-14 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-14">14. Economic Planning and the Development of a "Defence Economy"</span>
<p>
    To support its military objectives, the Reichswehr sought to develop a "defence economy" or "Wehrwirtschaft." This involved effective control of the economy to ensure it could be mobilized for war when necessary. Despite the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, which limited Germany's ability to openly rearm, the Reichswehr established an Economic Staff (Wirtschaftsstab) in 1924 to forge strong connections with German industry. This staff worked to create plans for a robust defense economy, laying the groundwork for a future rearmament .
</p>
<p>
    The establishment of a defense economy was a key element in the Reichswehr's strategy, reflecting its ambition to prepare Germany for future military campaigns. This required careful planning and covert activities, given the limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles. By focusing on economic control and building relationships with industry, the Reichswehr aimed to position Germany for a potential resurgence on the international stage .
</p>
<!--- section-15 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-15">15. The Reichswehr's Search for a Supportive Political Regime</span>
<p>
    The Reichswehr leadership desired a national regime that would support its military ambitions and fortify the morale of both troops and civilians in a future war. However, the Weimar Republic, with its democratic principles, did not align with the Reichswehr's goals. Wilhelm Groener, a former general and then national defense minister, believed that Germany needed to avoid ventures beyond its military means and required international cooperation to survive. Groener's more moderate views were not widely accepted among the Reichswehr leadership, especially after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent withdrawal of US loans, which exacerbated Germany's economic crisis .
</p>
<p>
    As unemployment soared and political instability increased, the Reichswehr leadership sought a regime more akin to its own authoritarian ideals. Initially, they considered a conservative authoritarian dictatorship but found it difficult to gain popular support. By the early 1930s, the Reichswehr leadership began to contemplate an alliance with the Nazis, who appeared to have the potential to command mass support, mobilize the German people, and stop the Communists. Despite some reservations about the Nazis' left-wing elements and the unruly behavior of the SA (Sturmabteilung), the Nazis' militaristic ideology and ability to inspire popular support made them an attractive option for the Reichswehr .
</p>
<!--- section-16 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-16">16. The Alliance with the Nazis and Hitler's Rise to Power</span>
<p>
    The alliance between the Reichswehr and the Nazis was driven by a shared belief in militarizing German society and a desire to restore Germany's military might. The Nazis' emphasis on nationalism and National Socialism, along with their commitment to the "community of blood and fate of all Germans," resonated with the Reichswehr leadership. Lieutenant General Werner von Blomberg, writing as Hitler's minister for war, highlighted the Nazis' commitment to nationalism and National Socialism, emphasizing the importance of these values in shaping the new state .
</p>
<p>
    On January 30, 1933, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, the president of the Weimar Republic, appointed Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany. This decision marked a turning point, with many conservative senior officers reassured that Hitler would lead a cabinet composed mostly of traditional conservatives. However, events unfolded differently as Hitler consolidated power, leading to the eventual dominance of the Nazi regime and its extreme ideologies .
