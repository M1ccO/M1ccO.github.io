<span class="subheading-text" id="section-1">1. The Gap Between Political Sphere and Civil Society</span>
<p>
    Since the book’s initial publication in 2011, one of Marx's key ideas has been strikingly confirmed: the existence of a gap between the political sphere and what he calls "civil society," encompassing social and economic existence. In the political realm, such as at the ballot box, individuals appear equal and autonomous, masking the actual divisions and inequalities of everyday life. The political dimension abstracts from these conditions, rendering citizens as mere shadows of their true selves. Marx argued that only by extending democratic self-government to civil society itself, for instance, through workers' self-management, could this gap be closed. The liberal-democratic political sphere is, therefore, less than fully real, and this realization has fueled significant unrest in the West. This unrest isn't limited to theoretical rejection but has manifested in overwhelming numbers on the streets. The disillusionment has grown so severe that even the most powerful nation is willing to elect a reality TV personality as a leader, highlighting a profound loss of faith in the conventional political process. This scenario reflects a mass rejection of the liberal middle-class political consensus, reminiscent of the 1930s, characterized by class warfare and talks of violent revolution, fueled by intense anger and despair. The ruling class faces unprecedented public disdain and ridicule, a stark contrast to the respect once commanded by leaders like Winston Churchill or John F. Kennedy.

<p>
    The left's response to this phenomenon is ambivalent. On one hand, the United Kingdom almost elected a left-wing socialist leader influenced by Karl Marx in 2017. On the other hand, the streets are filled with both left-wing and right-wing populism. The latter is characterized by racism, chauvinism, violence, and authoritarianism. Populism inherently carries this dual nature, embodying both egalitarian and ugly instincts. This right-wing populism represents one pole of a contradiction within capitalism itself. As the neoliberal market system becomes increasingly globalized, it generates constant flux and agitation, destabilizing secure identities and familiar coordinates. This upheaval creates anxiety among those who feel uprooted, leading to rancor and racism. Hatred often stems from fear rather than simple antagonism. The same person who wants to hang pedophiles and deport minorities might also be the affable executive who makes global deals, liberal and cosmopolitan in outlook. Political orthodoxy fails to acknowledge this connection, a point the political left has long emphasized. The aim is not to take sides but to understand how this contradiction is intrinsic to advanced capitalism, threatening to undermine it constantly. Marx's thought remains crucial for this understanding.

<p>
    Populism has a double-edged nature, embodying both egalitarian and reactionary tendencies. Right-wing populism, with its racist, chauvinistic, and authoritarian streak, is one side of the coin, while the other side reflects a backlash against the turmoil caused by globalized neoliberalism. This system's ceaseless flux destabilizes identities and creates profound anxiety, which can be exploited by reactionary forces. The same individual who supports harsh measures against perceived threats might also be a cosmopolitan executive, highlighting the contradictory nature of advanced capitalism. Political orthodoxy overlooks this connection, which only the political left insists upon. Understanding this contradiction is crucial, as it is deeply rooted in the nature of capitalism itself, making Marx's insights as relevant as ever.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-4">4. The Role of Marx's Thought in Modern Capitalism</span>
<p>
    The thought of Marx remains crucial for understanding the inherent contradictions in capitalism. Marx identified the historical object known as capitalism, revealing its origins, laws, and potential end. He unmasked the capitalist mode of production, much like Newton discovered gravity or Freud explored the unconscious. While this book does not delve into Marxism as a moral and cultural critique, the rich body of Marxist writing on alienation, commodification of social life, and cultural nihilism is a significant reason to align with Marxist thought. Despite criticism, Marx’s theories offer a valuable perspective on understanding the crises and contradictions within capitalism, emphasizing its relevance in the contemporary world.
