<p>
    So there we have it. Marx had a passionate faith in the individual and a
</p>
<p>
    deep suspicion of abstract dogma. He had no time for the concept of a
</p>
<p>
    perfect society, was wary of the notion of equality, and did not dream of a
</p>
<p>
    future in which we would all wear boiler suits with our National Insurance
</p>
<p>
    numbers stamped on our backs. It was diversity, not uniformity, that he
</p>
<p>
    hoped to see. Nor did he teach that men and women were the helpless
</p>
<p>
    playthings of history. He was even more hostile to the state than right-wing
</p>
<p>
    conservatives are, and saw socialism as a deepening of democracy, not as
</p>
<p>
    the enemy of it. His model of the good life was based on the idea of artistic
</p>
<p>
    self-expression. He believed that some revolutions might be peacefully
</p>
<p>
    accomplished, and was in no sense opposed to social reform. He did not
</p>
<p>
    focus narrowly on the manual working class. Nor did he see society in
</p>
<p>
    terms of two starkly polarised classes.
</p>
<p>
    He did not make a fetish of material production. On the contrary, he
</p>
<p>
    thought it should be done away with as far as possible. His ideal was
</p>
<p>
    leisure, not labour. If he paid such unflagging attention to the economic, it
</p>
<p>
    was in order to diminish its power over humanity. His materialism was fully
</p>
<p>
    compatible with deeply held moral and spiritual convictions. He lavished
</p>
<p>
    praise on the middle class, and saw socialism as the inheritor of its great
</p>
<p>
    legacies of liberty, civil rights and material prosperity. His views on Nature
</p>
<p>
    and the environment were for the most part startlingly in advance of his
</p>
<p>
    time. There has been no stauncher champion of womenâ€™s emancipation,
</p>
<p>
    world peace, the fight against fascism or the struggle for colonial freedom
</p>
<p>
    than the political movement to which his work gave birth.
</p>
<p>
    Was ever a thinker so travestied?
