<span class="subheading-text" id="section-1">1. Karl's Encounter with Robinson</span>
<p>
    One evening, Karl encounters Robinson, a former acquaintance, who greets him unexpectedly. Karl is surprised by Robinson's appearance, noting that while his clothes seem expensive, they are mismatched and shabby, highlighting his disheveled state. Robinson, evidently inebriated, attempts to show off his new vest with decorative but non-functional pockets. Despite Robinson's attempt to appear well-off, his drunkenness is evident to Karl, who is put off by the strong smell of alcohol. Robinson insists he doesn’t drink much, but his slurred speech and unstable behavior suggest otherwise. The conversation is interrupted when Karl is summoned to retrieve the hotel doctor for a fainted woman, hoping Robinson would leave by the time he returns. However, Robinson remains, persistently urging Karl to visit him and Delamarche, despite Karl's clear rejection and expression of past grievances caused by the two men. Robinson’s desperate state is underlined by his repeated pleas for Karl's company and his evident lack of stability, painting a picture of a man clinging to past connections in the face of present failures.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-2">2. Robinson's Condition and Plea</span>
<p>
    As Karl reluctantly engages with Robinson, it's clear Robinson is in a pitiable condition, heavily under the influence of alcohol and emotionally unstable. Robinson tries to reminisce and reestablish a bond, claiming that Delamarche wants to make amends and that they are living with a beautiful singer named Brunelda. Despite Robinson's pathetic state, Karl is wary and keeps his distance, mindful of the smell of alcohol and Robinson's erratic behavior. When Robinson asks Karl for money, Karl notices a hidden bottle of liquor in Robinson's pocket, confirming his suspicion that Robinson is still heavily drinking. Despite his annoyance and reluctance, Karl decides to give Robinson some money on the condition that he leaves and never comes back to the hotel. Robinson’s desperate plea for assistance reveals his dire straits and the complex, strained nature of his relationship with Karl. The interactions highlight themes of desperation, friendship, and the burden of past relationships, as Robinson clings to the hope of rekindling some form of support from Karl.

When Robinson shows signs of severe nausea and starts to vomit, Karl is forced to assist him, fearing the repercussions of being seen with a drunkard in the prestigious hotel. Karl contemplates the risk to his job and reputation if Robinson is discovered by other hotel staff or guests. Realizing the severity of Robinson’s condition, Karl decides to take a risk by moving him to a hidden corner near the elevators, hoping to avoid detection. This decision is driven by a mix of pity for Robinson and a pragmatic desire to prevent a scandal that could cost him his job. Karl’s internal conflict highlights the themes of loyalty, responsibility, and self-preservation as he navigates the precarious situation. His efforts to balance compassion with self-interest reflect the difficult choices faced by individuals in compromising situations.

The sight of Robinson, now completely incapacitated and vomiting uncontrollably, evokes a mixture of pity and frustration in Karl. He realizes the urgent need to get Robinson out of the hotel but is constrained by his work obligations and the presence of other staff and guests. This episode serves as a turning point, highlighting the depths of Robinson’s downfall and Karl’s growing desperation to find a resolution.

The presence of the hotel authorities brings a sense of impending doom, as Karl is aware that any misstep could lead to severe repercussions, including the loss of his job.

<p>
    Desperate to resolve the situation, Karl decides to move Robinson to his own bed in the staff dormitory, hoping to keep him hidden until he can sober up. This decision is fraught with risk, as the dormitory is frequently inspected, and any unauthorized presence could lead to severe disciplinary action. Karl’s plan involves enlisting the help of a fellow elevator boy to cover for him while he moves Robinson. The act of carrying Robinson, who is barely conscious and intermittently vomiting, through the hotel’s corridors is a tense and nerve-wracking endeavor. Karl’s determination to help Robinson despite the personal risk highlights his sense of duty and compassion, juxtaposed against the rigid and unforgiving environment of the hotel.

    The climax of the narrative occurs when Karl is summoned by the head waiter to explain his actions. Faced with accusations of negligence and misconduct, Karl tries to defend himself, but his explanations are met with skepticism and hostility. The head waiter’s harsh interrogation, combined with the presence of the strict and intimidating doorman, creates an atmosphere of intense pressure. Karl’s previous good conduct and hard work are dismissed, and he is judged solely on the current incident. The narrative culminates in a confrontation where Karl’s fate hangs in the balance, reflecting the harsh realities of his position and the unforgiving nature of the hierarchical structure within the hotel. The ordeal leaves Karl facing the potential loss of his job and the harsh judgment of his superiors, encapsulating the themes of vulnerability and the struggle for survival in a rigidly controlled environment.
