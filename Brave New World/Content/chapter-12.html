<span class="subheading-text" id="section-1">1. Overview of Hormones and Metabolic Regulators</span>
<p>
    Hormones are chemical messengers produced by specific cells that travel through the body to influence other cells. The human body produces numerous hormones, all of which impact mitochondrial function and cause epigenetic changes in their target cells, thereby altering cellular metabolism. Hormones can influence both mental and metabolic disorders. For example, testosterone can affect mood, energy, thoughts, motivations, and behaviors. Hormonal imbalances may result from autoimmune disorders, stress, aging, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Beyond hormones, other regulators of metabolism and mitochondrial function include neuropeptides, mitokines, adipokines, myokines, and various RNA molecules. These regulators control different aspects of metabolic function in different cells and situations, much like how traffic lights manage traffic flow. The need for such diverse regulators stems from the complexity of metabolic processes in the body. While an exhaustive review of all hormones is beyond this chapter’s scope, key hormones such as cortisol, insulin, estrogen, and thyroid hormone are examined to illustrate the connections between hormones, metabolism, and mitochondria.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-2">2. The Role of Cortisol in Mental and Metabolic Disorders</span>
<p>
    Cortisol, a crucial stress response hormone, links metabolism, mitochondria, and mental health. High cortisol levels have been associated with metabolic disorders and various mental symptoms, including anxiety, depression, mania, psychosis, and cognitive impairment. Cortisol production starts in the mitochondria, which contain the enzyme necessary for its synthesis. Once released into the bloodstream, cortisol enters cells and binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which then influences thousands of genes by attaching to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) on DNA. These genes’ proteins affect cellular metabolism. Interestingly, GRs are also present in mitochondria, underscoring cortisol’s role in metabolic regulation. Although cortisol was once considered a potential biomarker for mental illness, the relationship between cortisol levels and psychiatric conditions is complex. Cortisol can be either too high or too low in different psychiatric patients, influenced by factors such as trauma. Despite this complexity, cortisol undeniably connects metabolism and mitochondria with mental health. Its role in initiating and regulating metabolic processes, particularly in response to stress, highlights its importance in understanding both metabolic and mental disorders.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-3">3. Insulin and Its Connection to Mental Health</span>
<p>
    Insulin, widely known for its role in diabetes, also significantly affects mental health. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas produces insufficient insulin, while in type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance prevents effective glucose utilization. Emerging evidence suggests that mitochondria are crucial in insulin production and secretion. Mitochondria help regulate glucose metabolism and adjust insulin levels as needed. Mitochondrial dysfunction may be a primary cause of both types of diabetes. Insulin stimulates mitochondrial ATP production and biogenesis, but these effects are diminished in type 2 diabetes, exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction. Beyond diabetes, insulin directly influences brain function. Insulin receptors are found throughout the brain, regulating metabolism, appetite, reproduction, liver function, fat storage, and body temperature. Insulin modulates neurotransmitter activity and mitochondrial function in brain cells. Insulin resistance in the brain can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotransmitter imbalances, contributing to mental disorders. Research shows that insulin resistance in the brain may precede mental disorders such as psychosis. For example, brain scans of people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder revealed insulin resistance. Additionally, a study of nearly 15,000 children linked persistent high insulin levels from childhood with a higher risk of psychosis and bipolar disorder in early adulthood. Alzheimer’s disease is also associated with brain insulin resistance, termed "type 3 diabetes," which impairs glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-4">4. Estrogen's Impact on Mental and Metabolic Health</span>
<p>
    Estrogen, a hormone primarily associated with female reproductive health, also plays a significant role in metabolism and mental health. Estrogen affects brain metabolism directly and has widespread effects on mood, cognition, and other brain functions. Mitochondria play a crucial role in estrogen production, and estrogen receptors are found both on mitochondria and throughout the brain on neurons and glial cells. Estrogen levels fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle, influencing mood, appetite, and cravings. These hormonal changes can exacerbate symptoms in women with mental disorders, leading to diagnoses like premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Women are twice as likely to develop depression as men, possibly due to hormonal fluctuations and the metabolic impact of menstruation. Pregnancy and postpartum periods are also high-risk times for mental symptoms due to significant hormonal changes and the metabolic demands of pregnancy. Conditions such as postpartum depression, mania, and psychosis are common. Menopause, marked by a sharp decline in estrogen levels, is associated with increased risks of depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and Alzheimer’s disease. Studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that estrogen replacement can improve memory and mitochondrial function, suggesting potential benefits for postmenopausal women. However, hormone treatments like oral contraception and hormone replacement therapy must be carefully managed due to varying effects on mood and mental health.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-5">5. Thyroid Hormone's Role in Metabolism and Mental Health</span>
<p>
    Thyroid hormone, known as the master regulator of metabolism, affects every cell in the human body. It increases mitochondrial activity, boosting ATP production and cellular metabolism. Thyroid hormone also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, essential for maintaining mitochondrial health. Hypothyroidism, or low thyroid hormone levels, can lead to weight gain, obesity, heart disease, fatigue, brain fog, and depression. It is also linked to bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and dementia. Hypothyroidism during development can cause severe neurological deficits. Thyroid hormone’s effects on mitochondria explain its wide-ranging impact on health. It increases cellular energy production, improves mitochondrial function, and enhances the overall metabolic rate. This makes thyroid hormone a potential treatment for mental disorders, even in individuals with normal thyroid levels. High-dose thyroid hormone is used in treatment-resistant depression and bipolar disorder, improving symptoms by enhancing mitochondrial function. However, increasing thyroid hormone levels must be carefully monitored to avoid overstimulation and adverse effects. The brain energy theory explains the connection between thyroid hormone, mitochondrial function, and mental health, providing a comprehensive understanding of how thyroid hormone influences various conditions.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-6">6. Hormonal Treatments and Success Stories</span>
<p>
    Hormonal treatments can significantly impact mental and metabolic health. For example, high-dose thyroid hormone has been successfully used to treat treatment-resistant depression and bipolar disorder. James, a fifty-four-year-old man with a long history of bipolar disorder, experienced crippling depression every fall. Despite trying multiple antidepressants and mood stabilizers, his condition did not improve. He was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and sleep apnea. Normal doses of thyroid medication did not alleviate his depression, but high-dose thyroid hormone treatment made a significant difference. His depression improved, and he was able to reduce the dose after about ten years, maintaining good mental health with occasional low-dose antidepressants and sleep medication. This success story illustrates the potential benefits of hormonal treatments in managing mental health conditions. Estrogen treatments, such as oral contraception and hormone replacement therapy, also play a role in managing mood symptoms related to hormonal fluctuations. However, these treatments must be tailored to individual needs, as they can have varying effects on mood and mental health. Monitoring hormone levels and working with healthcare providers to manage treatments is crucial for optimizing mental health outcomes.
