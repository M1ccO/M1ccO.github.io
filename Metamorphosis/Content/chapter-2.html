Gregor is drawn to the door by the smell of food, indicating a change in his usual routine and physical state. His discovery of a bowl of milk, once a favored drink, now repels him, highlighting a shift in his preferences and physical abilities.
</p>

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-2">2. Gregor's Physical Transformation</span>
<p>
    Gregor's transformation is marked by his struggle with his new form, experiencing pain and difficulty in movement. His attempt to eat the milk and bread provided by his sister results in disappointment, as his taste and ability to consume food have altered. This incident underscores the physical and existential changes Gregor is undergoing, leading to a deeper sense of alienation from his previous life and identity.
</p>

<p>
    The text delves into the impact of Gregor's condition on his family dynamics, revealing a shift from intimacy to isolation. The silence and absence of usual family rituals, such as reading aloud, signify a breakdown in communication and connection. Gregor's reflections on his family's quiet life and his role in providing for them highlight the increasing gulf between his current existence and his previous life as a human.
</p>

<p>
    The family's financial situation is disclosed, revealing that Gregor's contributions had been saved, forming a small capital. This discovery leads to discussions about the family's future livelihood, emphasizing the need for someone to undertake the responsibility of earning, given Gregor's father's age and his mother and sister's limitations.
</p>
<!--- section-7 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-7">7. Gregor's Newfound Mobility and Isolation</span>
<p>
    Gregor's adaptation to his new form allows him newfound mobility, enabling him to explore his room in ways previously impossible. This mobility, however, also highlights his growing isolation, as his family members, particularly his sister, make efforts to accommodate his needs while struggling with their own discomfort and fear.
</p>
<!--- section-8 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-8">8. The Furniture Dilemma</span>
<p>
    A debate arises within the family regarding the removal of furniture from Gregor's room to give him more space. This situation brings to light differing opinions on how best to support Gregor, with his sister advocating for more space for him to move, while his mother worries that removing the furniture signifies giving up hope on his recovery.
</p>

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-9">9. Intervention and Conflict</span>
<p>
    As the family continues to remove furniture from Gregor's room, his attachment to certain items sparks an intervention. Gregor's attempt to save a cherished portrait leads to a direct conflict with his sister, Greta, who seeks to protect their mother from the shock of Gregor's appearance.
</p>
<!--- section-10 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-10">10. Gregor's Desperation</span>
<p>
    The noise and chaos from the furniture removal, combined with Gregor's increasing isolation and inability to communicate his desires, push him to desperation. His futile attempts to intervene and preserve some semblance of his former human life highlight his profound sense of loss and alienation.
</p>
<!--- section-11 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-11">11. The Father's Transformation</span>
<p>
    Gregor is taken aback by his father's changed appearance and demeanor. Once a passive and lethargic figure, his father now exudes authority and determination, wearing a uniform that symbolizes a newfound purpose and responsibility within the family.
</p>
<!--- section-12 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-12">12. The Climactic Confrontation</span>
<p>
