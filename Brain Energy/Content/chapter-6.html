<!--- section-1 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-1">1. Introduction: Normal Emotions vs. Mental Disorders</span>
<p>
    Distinguishing between normal human emotions and mental disorders is a major challenge in the mental health field, as the symptoms can often be the same. Everyone experiences anxiety or mild depression occasionally, and severe depression can follow devastating events like the unexpected death of a spouse. These reactions are hardwired into our brains and are typically considered normal. However, when individuals are exposed to numerous or extreme stressors, these normal reactions can quickly escalate into what is classified as mental illness. Trauma or extreme stress can lead to various disorders such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, eating disorders, substance use disorders, personality disorders, and psychosis. Distinguishing between normal reactions to adversity and mental disorders is crucial for appropriate treatment.
</p>
<!--- section-2 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-2">2. Understanding “Normal”: Stress and the Stress Response</span>
<p>
    Stressors, which are psychological and social factors, play a significant role in mental health. These factors are interconnected with biological aspects, influencing both mental and metabolic symptoms. Humans are inherently social beings, relying on connections with others for safety and support. However, relationships and societal roles can also be primary sources of stress. Chronic stressors can stem from socioeconomic status, abuse, neglect, discrimination, and other factors, leading to various stress responses.
</p>
<p>
    The stress response involves changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis, inflammation, and gene expression, especially in the hippocampus. These biological changes affect metabolism and prepare the body for "fight or flight," even in day-to-day stressful situations. While resilient individuals can quickly recover from mild stress, those with compromised metabolism or severe stress may develop new mental or metabolic disorders. Stress can exacerbate preexisting conditions, leading to worsened symptoms.
</p>
<!--- section-3 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-3">3. Limited Resources and Their Impact on Mental Health</span>
<p>
    Stress diverts metabolic resources to the body's defense systems, reducing energy available for other functions. This can lead to impaired cell maintenance and increased susceptibility to disorders. High levels of cortisol inhibit autophagy, a process where cells clean out damaged components, leading to further issues in neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and psychiatric disorders. Stress also disrupts protein synthesis, forming stress granules linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Sleep disruption, common under stress, impairs the body’s ability to perform maintenance functions, exacerbating health problems.
</p>
<p>
    Chronic stress accelerates aging, with studies showing that prolonged stress can significantly shorten lifespan. For example, mothers caring for chronically ill children exhibited signs of accelerated aging compared to those with healthy children. This indicates that stress plays a significant role in overall health, consuming energy needed for proper cell function and maintenance. Stress-reduction practices can help, but for those in adverse environments, eliminating the stressor is often necessary for meaningful improvement.
</p>
<!--- section-4 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-4">4. Defining Mental Illness: A New Perspective</span>
<p>
    Current classifications of mental disorders are problematic, often lacking validity and clear distinctions between conditions. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIH) developed the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to reframe mental illnesses by focusing on domains of functioning—emotion, cognition, motivation, and social behavior—rather than diagnostic labels. The brain energy theory aligns with this approach, suggesting that mental illnesses result from the brain not functioning properly over time, causing persistent symptoms that lead to suffering or impairment in functioning.
</p>
<ol><p class= "bold">The new definition of mental illness includes four components:</p>
    <li>The brain is not working properly.</li>
    <li>This results in mental symptoms.</li>
    <li>The malfunction persists over time.</li>
    <li>The symptoms cause suffering or impairment in functioning.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<p class= "bold">Symptoms of mental illness can be categorized into three broad scenarios:</p>
    <li><p class= "bold">Overactive Brain Functions:</p><p>Hyperexcitability of brain cells and networks, such as in anxiety or OCD.</p>
</li>
    <li><p class= "bold">Underactive Brain Functions:</p><p>Reduced activity in brain regions, as seen in ADHD or cognitive impairments in psychiatric disorders.</p>
</li>
    <li><p class= "bold">Absence of Specific Brain Functions:</p><p>Permanent changes due to developmental problems or cell death, common in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This comprehensive approach helps in understanding and treating mental disorders more effectively by focusing on brain functions and their regulation.

<!--- section-5 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-5">5. Symptoms of Mental Illness</span>
<p>
    Mental illness symptoms are manifestations of normal brain functions gone awry. These functions may be overactive, underactive, or completely absent. Understanding mental disorders requires a detailed look at these variations and how they affect behavior, cognition, emotions, and overall functioning.
</p>
<!--- section-6 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-6">6. Overactive Brain Functions</span>
<p>
    Hyperexcitability or overactivity in brain cells and networks is a hallmark of many mental disorders. For example, fear and anxiety often stem from the amygdala, a brain region involved in the fear response. When these neurons fire excessively or inappropriately, it results in anxiety symptoms, sometimes triggered without any real threat. Similarly, obsessions and compulsions in OCD are due to hyperexcitable cells in brain areas responsible for grooming and checking behaviors. This overactivity leads to repetitive, intrusive thoughts and actions.
</p>
<p>
    Psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, can also arise from overactive brain functions. Auditory hallucinations, for instance, occur when brain cells that process sound become hyperexcitable, causing individuals to hear things that aren't there. Neurosurgeons have demonstrated that stimulating certain brain areas with electrodes can induce hallucinations, mimicking the effects seen in psychotic disorders. Additionally, abnormalities in inhibitory neurons, which typically slow down activity in other neurons, can lead to overactivity. This lack of inhibition has been observed in disorders like schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and autism.
</p>
<p>
    Another potential explanation for psychotic symptoms involves the brain's sleep systems. Hallucinations and delusions are common during sleep in the form of dreams. If these systems become hyperexcitable and activate during wakefulness, they could cause the hallucinations and delusions seen in mental disorders.
</p>
<!--- section-7 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-7">7. Underactive Brain Functions</span>
<p>
    Underactivity in brain cells and networks is another common feature of mental disorders. This condition implies that the cells are still alive but not functioning optimally, leading to symptoms that can wax and wane. In ADHD, for example, there is a reduction in the activity of norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus, affecting focus, planning, and task completion.
</p>
<p>
    Cognitive impairments, such as memory problems, often result from underactive neurons involved in memory storage and retrieval. These impairments are evident in Alzheimer's disease and many chronic psychiatric disorders, where cognitive deficits are a significant component. Depression can involve underactivity in the default mode network, leading to a slowing or disorganization of normal brain functions.
</p>
<p>
    Emotional regulation issues, seen in mood, personality, and anxiety disorders, also stem from underactive brain systems. These systems are designed to help control emotional responses and regulate moods. When they are underactive, individuals may experience unstable moods and anger outbursts.
</p>
<!--- section-8 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-8">8. Absence of Specific Brain Functions</span>
<p>
    Certain mental disorders involve permanent changes in brain cells and connections due to developmental problems or cell death. Neurodevelopmental disorders, like autism, are characterized by missing or different neurons and connections. Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, involve brain shrinkage and neuron death, leading to fixed cognitive deficits.
</p>
<p>
    Symptoms due to these permanent changes are always present and do not fluctuate. For instance, the social deficits in autism and some cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease remain constant. However, both conditions can also exhibit ongoing mental symptoms that vary in intensity, such as anxiety, psychosis, and mood changes.
</p>
<p>
    The distinctions between overactive, underactive, and absent brain functions help categorize and understand the symptoms of mental disorders. However, two additional situations—multifaceted brain adaptations and behavioral disorders—add complexity to this framework.
</p>
<!--- section-9 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-9">9. Multifaceted Brain Adaptations</span>
<p>
    The brain's responses to situations can involve multiple symptoms, with some functions activated and others deactivated. Depression, hypomania, and trauma responses are examples of normal adaptive reactions that can become disorders when they are overactive. Depression can include changes in mood, energy, appetite, and sleep, with variations in symptoms among individuals. Hypomania, often occurring when people fall in love or are excited about a project, involves increased energy and productivity but can become problematic when exaggerated.
</p>
<p>
    The trauma response includes symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance, and hypervigilance. These responses are normal after traumatic events but can become disorders if they persist or are excessively intense. Multifaceted brain adaptations become disorders when they are activated at the wrong time, last too long, or result in excessive symptoms.
</p>
<!--- section-10 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-10">10. Behavioral Disorders</span>
<p>
    Behavioral disorders, such as substance use and eating disorders, show strong bidirectional relationships with other mental disorders. These behaviors are controlled by brain pathways related to cravings, appetite, motivation, self-control, and impulsivity. Mental disorders can lead to substance use and changes in eating behaviors as coping mechanisms, known as the self-medication hypothesis.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, individuals may begin engaging in these behaviors due to peer pressure, even if they are initially metabolically healthy. Substance use and eating behaviors can profoundly affect metabolism and brain function, leading to metabolic abnormalities and further entrenching these behaviors into disorders.
</p>
<p>
    Understanding mental disorders through the lens of overactive, underactive, and absent brain functions, along with multifaceted adaptations and behavioral components, provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosis and treatment. This approach aligns with the brain energy theory, offering a unified explanation for the diverse manifestations of mental illnesses.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<!--- section-11 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-11">11. Complexity of Mental Illness</span>
<p>
    Identifying the causes of mental illness is challenging due to the inconsistency in neuroscience findings and symptom variability among individuals with the same diagnosis. Developmental abnormalities, cell death, and fluctuating symptoms contribute to this complexity. The brain energy theory posits that all symptoms of mental disorders can be traced back to disruptions in metabolism and mitochondrial function, offering a unifying explanation. This theory addresses how different parts of the brain become overactive or underactive, leading to mental illness symptoms. The variability in symptoms and brain changes among individuals highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to understanding and treating mental disorders.
</p>
<!--- section-12 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-12">12. Car Analogy for Understanding Mental States and Disorders</span>
<p>
    The car analogy illustrates the difference between normal stress responses and mental disorders using three cars, all the same make and model, representing different human experiences:
</p>
<p>
    -Car A: Lives in ideal conditions, driven infrequently, and receives regular maintenance. It represents a person with minimal stress and optimal health, facing few challenges and requiring little adaptation.
</p>
<p>
    -Car B: Faces harsh conditions, driven daily, and lacks a garage. It requires adaptations like snow tires and chains, akin to stress responses like anxiety or depression. Although it has more maintenance issues and a shorter lifespan, these are normal given its environment. This car demonstrates how normal stress responses help navigate difficult environments but also result in more wear and tear.
</p>
<p>
    -Car C: Operates under moderate conditions but exhibits malfunctioning behaviors, such as using windshield wipers on sunny days and not turning on headlights at night. This car represents a person with a mental disorder, where brain functions are overactive, underactive, or misaligned, leading to significant health and safety issues. These malfunctions are akin to inappropriate or missing brain responses seen in mental illnesses.
</p>
<p>
    People facing adversity, like Car B, need support and environmental changes, while those with mental disorders, like Car C, require treatments targeting brain function.
</p>
<!--- section-13 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-13">13. Human Example: Pain</span>
<p>
    Pain serves as a straightforward example to understand mental symptoms. Controlled by nerve cells and brain regions, pain can be categorized into three types based on cellular function:
</p>
<p>
    -Overactivity: Hyperexcitability of pain pathways, as seen in conditions like diabetic neuropathy, where pain occurs without an injury. These neurons fire excessively, causing chronic pain.
</p>
<p>
    -Underactivity: Reduced pain sensation, also seen in diabetic neuropathy, where individuals feel less pain than normal due to impaired nerve function.
</p>
<p>
    -Absence of Pain: Complete loss of sensation due to severe diabetes, spinal cord injuries, or strokes, where affected areas feel nothing because the neurons are dead or severely damaged.
</p>
<p>
    These scenarios parallel mental disorders, where brain functions can be overly active, insufficiently active, or entirely absent. Understanding these distinctions helps clarify why some mental symptoms are more intense, persistent, or absent than others.
</p>
<!--- section-14 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-14">14. Understanding Disorders through the Brain Energy Theory</span>
<p>
    Defining mental illness as a malfunction in brain function over time, resulting in symptoms that cause suffering or impairment, offers a clear framework. This definition includes four key components:
</p>
<p>
    1. Brain malfunction: Difficult to measure with current technologies, yet essential for diagnosis. Mental illnesses often involve brain functions that occur at inappropriate times, last too long, or fail to activate when needed.
</p>
<p>
    2. Resultant symptoms: Indicators of abnormal brain function, such as hallucinations, anxiety, or memory lapses. These symptoms are often extensions of normal brain functions gone awry.
</p>
<p>
    3. Persistence over time: Symptoms must be ongoing to be considered a disorder. Short-lived experiences, like a bad day or temporary stress, do not constitute mental illness.
</p>
<p>
    4. Impact on functioning: Symptoms must cause distress or impair daily life. This impairment can affect various aspects of life, including work, relationships, and self-care.
</p>
<p>
    For instance, panic attacks represent an overactive panic system, while memory impairment in dementia shows underactive brain functions. Understanding these distinctions helps in developing targeted treatments and recognizing that stress can exacerbate both normal and disordered states.
</p>
<p>
    Mental health professionals must evaluate the underlying causes of symptoms before diagnosing a disorder, much like diagnosing a physical ailment. Effective treatment requires addressing both environmental factors and brain function. By focusing on the brain's metabolic health, the brain energy theory provides a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and treating mental disorders.

<!--- section-15 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-15">15. Defining Mental Illness: A New Perspective</span>
<p>
    Mental illness is best defined as a malfunction in brain function over time, resulting in symptoms that cause suffering or impairment. This definition comprises four key components: brain malfunction, resultant symptoms, persistence over time, and impact on functioning. Although current technologies struggle to measure brain malfunction precisely, symptoms are the best indicators of abnormal brain function. These symptoms can be categorized into overactivity, underactivity, or absence of function.
</p>
<p>
    Mental illnesses manifest when normal brain functions occur inappropriately, last too long, or fail to activate when needed. For example, a panic attack represents an overactive panic system, while memory impairment in dementia shows underactive brain functions. This framework, supported by the brain energy theory, suggests that metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunctions underlie these malfunctions.
</p>
<!--- section-16 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-16">16. Multifaceted Brain Adaptations</span>
<p>
    The brain's responses to situations can involve multiple symptoms, with some functions activated and others deactivated. Depression, hypomania, and trauma responses are examples of normal adaptive reactions that can become disorders when overactive. Depression typically includes changes in mood, energy, appetite, and sleep, which vary among individuals. Hypomania involves increased energy and productivity and can occur during periods of excitement or accomplishment. Trauma responses include flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance, and hypervigilance, which are normal after traumatic events but can become disorders if persistent.
</p>
<p>
    These multifaceted brain adaptations become disorders when they are activated at inappropriate times, last too long, or result in excessive symptoms. For instance, hyperexcitable pain cells can fire for no clear reason or be triggered by minor injuries. Similarly, brain systems involved in depression or trauma can become "stuck" in an "on" position, causing persistent and exaggerated symptoms.
</p>
<!--- section-17 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-17">17. Behavioral Disorders</span>
<p>
    Behavioral disorders, such as substance use and eating disorders, show strong bidirectional relationships with other mental disorders. These behaviors are controlled by brain pathways related to cravings, appetite, motivation, self-control, and impulsivity. Mental disorders can lead to substance use and changes in eating behaviors as coping mechanisms, known as the self-medication hypothesis.
</p>
<p>
    Individuals may also engage in these behaviors due to peer pressure, even if they are initially metabolically healthy. Substance use and eating behaviors can profoundly affect metabolism and brain function, leading to metabolic abnormalities and further entrenching these behaviors into disorders. Behavioral disorders are complex, involving both environmental influences and inherent brain function disruptions.
</p>
<!--- section-18 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-18">18. A Complex Puzzle</span>
<p>
    Understanding the causes of mental illness involves untangling the complex interactions between brain function, metabolic health, and environmental factors. Findings such as reduced default-mode network activity in depression are not consistent across individuals with the same disorder or even in the same person at different times. This variability complicates the development of diagnostic tests and underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to mental health.
</p>
<p>
    The brain energy theory posits that disruptions in metabolism and mitochondrial function underlie the diverse manifestations of mental disorders. This theory accounts for the overactivity, underactivity, and absence of specific brain functions observed in mental illness. It also explains why symptoms wax and wane and how developmental abnormalities or areas of cell shrinkage and death contribute to different disorders.
</p>
<p>
    By focusing on metabolic health and brain function, the brain energy theory offers a unified explanation for mental illnesses. It emphasizes the importance of addressing both environmental factors and brain function in diagnosing and treating these conditions. This comprehensive approach can lead to more effective treatments and a better understanding of mental health.
