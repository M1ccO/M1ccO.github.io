<span class="subheading-text" id="section-1">1. Overview of Current Treatments and Their Mechanisms</span>
<p>
    Current evidence-based treatments for mental disorders include psychotherapy, medications, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), brain surgery, and the use of electrical stimulators. Despite their differences, these treatments all impact metabolism and mitochondria, which can be explained by the brain energy theory. This theory suggests that improving mitochondrial function and energy production in the brain is key to alleviating symptoms of mental disorders. Understanding how these diverse treatments influence brain energy can provide a comprehensive explanation for their effectiveness.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-2">2. ECT and TMS</span>
<p>
    Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are effective for a variety of mental disorders. ECT is considered the gold standard for severe depression and catatonia. The exact mechanisms are not fully understood, but both treatments are believed to increase neurotransmitter levels, improve hormone balance, and enhance neuroplasticity. According to the brain energy theory, ECT and TMS work by delivering energy directly to the brain, stimulating mitochondria, and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis. This process is similar to how physical exercise increases mitochondrial production in muscles.
</p>
<p>
    Studies show that ECT increases mitochondrial activity in the hippocampus, striatum, and cortex of rats. Another study found that ECT enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and synapse formation in the hippocampus, with lasting improvements after a series of treatments. TMS has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, decrease inflammation, increase neuroplasticity, and affect neurotransmitter levels, all related to mitochondrial function. For example, TMS has been found to increase ATP levels and mitochondrial integrity in rat models of stroke. These findings support the idea that ECT and TMS improve mental health by enhancing brain energy and mitochondrial function.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-3">3. Brain Surgery and Electrical Stimulators</span>
<p>
    Brain surgery is sometimes used as a last resort for chronic, debilitating mental disorders. It can help by either removing hyperactive brain regions or by implanting electrodes to stimulate underactive areas. This approach is similar to treatments for epilepsy, where removing or isolating overactive brain regions reduces symptoms. Implanting electrodes works like a pacemaker, stimulating brain regions to improve function.
</p>
<p>
    Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) involves applying electrical stimulators to the vagus nerve, which has been effective for epilepsy and depression. VNS is also being studied for PTSD, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, OCD, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, and fibromyalgia. This wide range of applications suggests a common underlying mechanism, which can be explained by the brain energy theory. VNS likely improves mitochondrial function and brain energy, helping to alleviate symptoms across these diverse conditions.
</p>
<p>
    Summing up, for severe, treatment-resistant conditions or life-threatening emergencies, ECT, TMS, VNS, and brain surgery can play crucial roles. However, the brain energy theory provides numerous other treatment options that may be effective before resorting to these more invasive methods. Understanding how these treatments impact brain energy and mitochondrial function can lead to better, more targeted therapies for mental disorders.
