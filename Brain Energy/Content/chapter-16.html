<!-- IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS -->
<!--- section-1 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-1">1. Introduction to Drugs, Alcohol, and Mental Disorders</span>
<p>
    Drugs and alcohol are known to lead to mental disorders, and people with mental disorders are more likely to use these substances. Examples include the young man who develops schizophrenia from excessive marijuana use, the alcoholic who suffers from dementia, and the cocaine addict with bipolar disorder. These effects are often attributed to the toxic impact of drugs on the brain or a predisposition to mental illness that drugs exacerbate. The brain energy theory provides a comprehensive explanation, suggesting that drugs and alcohol affect mental health by disrupting metabolism and mitochondrial function.
</p>
<!--- section-2 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-2">2. Mechanisms of Drug and Alcohol Effects</span>
<p>
    Most drugs either stimulate or inhibit cells. This includes substances like alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, and opiates. Some drugs target specific cells, while others have widespread effects throughout the body. For instance, alcohol and marijuana act on receptors found on cell surfaces, impacting the mitochondria within those cells. Mitochondria themselves have receptors for substances like marijuana, nicotine, alcohol, and Valium, allowing these drugs to directly affect mitochondrial function.
</p>
<p>
    Drugs and alcohol create a feedback loop with metabolism and mitochondria, making it challenging to break free once a person starts using these substances. Initially, people may use drugs or alcohol due to social influences or to feel better if they are already metabolically compromised. Over time, substance use impairs metabolism and mitochondrial function, leading to dependency. The brain adapts to the substances, causing individuals to need them to feel "normal," not necessarily "good." This vicious cycle traps individuals in substance use.
</p>
<!--- section-3 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-3">3. Alcohol and Its Impact on Mitochondria</span>
<p>
    Alcohol significantly affects metabolism and mitochondrial function, particularly in the liver and brain. When alcohol is consumed, the liver processes it with enzymes like alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), converting alcohol into acetaldehyde, a toxic molecule. Acetaldehyde is further converted into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and acetate is used by mitochondria as a fuel source.
</p>
<p>
    Excessive alcohol consumption leads to the accumulation of acetaldehyde, causing mitochondrial impairment, swelling, reduced ATP production, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Chronic alcohol use results in sustained oxidative stress, inflammation, and lasting mitochondrial damage. Studies show that even short periods of heavy drinking can have long-term effects on mitochondrial function, particularly in the brain's hippocampus.
</p>
<p>
    Research by Dr. Nora Volkow and others reveals that chronic alcoholics use less glucose and more acetate for brain energy. This shift causes energy deficits in brain cells when sober, making alcohol consumption necessary to provide relief. A study involving a ketogenic diet for alcohol use disorder showed improved brain metabolism, reduced inflammation, and fewer cravings for alcohol, demonstrating the potential of dietary interventions in treating addiction.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-4">4. Marijuana and Its Impact on Mitochondria</span>
<p>
    Marijuana, widely regarded as a "cure-all," can cause both beneficial and harmful effects. It is used to treat seizures, pain, nausea, anxiety, PTSD, and OCD, but it can also impair learning, memory, motivation, and potentially lead to psychotic disorders. The brain energy theory explains these effects through marijuana's impact on metabolism and mitochondria.
</p>
<p>
    Marijuana affects the endocannabinoid system, with receptors (CB1 and CB2) highly concentrated in the brain. CB1 receptors are found on cell membranes and mitochondria. Marijuana predominantly slows mitochondrial function through CB1 receptors, impacting brain regions and behaviors. Studies show that marijuana users have accelerated cortical thinning in brain regions with high CB1 receptor concentrations.
</p>
<p>
    Research on mice has shown that mitochondrial CB1 receptors in astrocytes control energy sources for neurons, affecting social behaviors. THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, reduces mitochondrial function and energy supply, leading to social withdrawal. Removing CB1 receptors eliminates these effects, highlighting the role of mitochondria in marijuana's impact on the brain.
</p>
<!--- section-5 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-5">5. Drug and Alcohol Treatment</span>
<p>
    Treating drug and alcohol addiction is crucial for improving mental and metabolic health. Reducing or stopping substance use is essential to restore mitochondrial function. Various strategies are available, including inpatient detox, residential programs, outpatient therapy, group therapy, medication-assisted treatments, twelve-step programs, and halfway houses. Emerging research on psychedelics shows potential for treating certain psychiatric disorders, which will be discussed in Chapter 18.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-6">6. Summing Up</span>
<p>
    - Drugs and alcohol significantly impact metabolism and mitochondria.
</p>
<p>
    - Withdrawal from these substances can also affect metabolism and mitochondria in different ways.
</p>
<p>
    - Assess your use of substances, including tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, supplements, marijuana, and recreational drugs, as they may influence your metabolic and mental health.
</p>
<p>
    - Heavy use of these substances could be a significant contributing cause to metabolic or mental symptoms, and addressing this is often necessary before other interventions can be effective.
</p>
<p>
    - If you struggle to reduce or stop substance use on your own, consider seeking professional help.
