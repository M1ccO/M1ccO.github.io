<!-- IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS -->
<!--- section-1 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-1">1. Mental Health Crisis</span>
<p>
    In 2017, nearly 800 million people worldwide suffered from mental health disorders, representing over 10% of the global population. When substance use disorders are included, the number jumps to 970 million, about 13% of the global population. In the United States, the rates are even higher, with approximately 20% of the population diagnosed with a mental or substance use disorder. Anxiety disorders are the most common, affecting about 3.8% of people worldwide, while depression affects around 3.4%. However, the lifetime prevalence rates in the US suggest that about 50% of the population will meet the criteria for a mental disorder at some point in their lives. This high prevalence is partially due to societal stigma and discrimination, which lead many people to underreport or hide their symptoms, indicating that the actual prevalence of these disorders might be much higher than reported.
</p>
<!--- section-2 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-2">2. Rising Rates of Mental Illness</span>
<p>
    Mental illness rates in the United States are rising, particularly among young adults. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), US adults over the age of eighteen experienced higher rates of mental illness in 2017 compared to most years between 2008 and 2015. The age group of eighteen through twenty-five saw the largest increase, with rates rising by 40% between 2008 and 2017. ADHD rates in children and adolescents have also seen significant growth, with a 41% increase between 2003 and 2012. This rise in ADHD rates is controversial, with some attributing it to improved diagnosis while others suggest it might be due to overmedication or unrealistic societal expectations. Additionally, depression rates have increased among children aged twelve to seventeen, with a 68% increase from 2006 to 2017, and among young adults aged eighteen to twenty-five, with a 49% increase. These trends reflect the growing burden of mental health issues in the United States and highlight the need for effective interventions.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-3">3. The Stigma of Mental Illness</span>
<p>
    Stigma surrounding mental illness poses a significant barrier to treatment and societal acceptance. It often leads to discrimination and underreporting, manifesting in various forms. Those with depression and anxiety are sometimes dismissed as "whiny" or "lazy," while those with psychotic disorders are often labeled as "crazy" or dangerous. Substance use disorders face even more severe stigmas, with some regions criminalizing these conditions. This stigma drives many people to hide or downplay their symptoms, contributing to underreporting and further discrimination. The fear of being stigmatized discourages many from seeking help, which exacerbates the mental health crisis and contributes to the underestimation of mental illness prevalence

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-4">4. Dramatic Increase in Diagnoses</span>
<p>
    The rapid rise in diagnoses such as autism and bipolar disorder has sparked debates about data accuracy and interpretation. The prevalence of autism in children increased from 1 in 150 in 2000 to 1 in 59 by 2014. Bipolar disorder, once rare in children and adolescents, has become more common, with the prevalence growing from 0.4%–1.6% in the mid-1970s to 4%–7% by the early 2000s. This sharp increase has raised concerns about the underlying causes, with some pointing to the influence of pharmaceutical companies and changing societal behavior. It also calls for a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to this increase, as the rapid rise in diagnoses could indicate overdiagnosis or misdiagnosis. The growing number of diagnoses highlights the need for a reevaluation of diagnostic practices and a better understanding of the societal factors contributing to these trends.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-5">5. Behavioral and Social Changes</span>
<p>
    As mental health disorders rise, there are two primary categories of theories to explain these changes. The first category suggests that these illnesses are truly increasing due to various societal factors. The second category rationalizes the statistics as the result of improved recognition and diagnosis, acknowledging a broader understanding of mental disorders. However, evidence shows that it's not just improved recognition driving these statistics; the actual rates of these disorders are genuinely increasing. A prime example is the impact of technology and screens on our daily lives, with increased screen time leading to more isolation and less social interaction. Additionally, our fast-paced, over-scheduled lifestyles contribute to the stress experienced by both adults and children. These changes in behavior and society create an environment that fosters an increase in mental disorders, raising more questions than answers..
</p>
<!--- section-6 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-6">6. Societal Factors Impacting Mental Health</span>
<p>
    Beyond behavioral changes, other societal factors contribute to the rise in mental health disorders. Environmental factors such as exposure to toxins and chemicals, along with artificial ingredients in our food and personal hygiene products, are thought to play a role in increasing rates of various illnesses, including cancer, obesity, and mental disorders. The impact of these external factors on our physical world can have far-reaching effects, leading to the speculation that they may contribute to genetic mutations or other biological changes that impact mental health. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll, with an estimated 40% of US adults in June 2020 reporting struggles with mental health or substance use issues. These societal influences create additional stress and uncertainty, potentially contributing to the rising rates of mental disorders.
</p>
<!--- section-7 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-7">7. Mental Health's Economic Impact</span>
<p>
    The cost of mental disorders to society is staggering. In 2010, the financial toll worldwide was $2.5 trillion, and it's projected to reach $6 trillion by 2030. These costs include direct mental healthcare services, such as hospitalizations, doctor visits, therapy, and prescription medications, as well as lost productivity due to employees becoming less focused or taking sick leave. Depression, which tops the list of disabling illnesses, contributes to this financial burden, resulting in "years lost to disability" and "overall disease burden." Beyond the financial impact, mental disorders cause significant suffering and disruption to individuals and families, often leading to social isolation, disrupted school and career plans, and increased risk of divorce. The strain on families and loved ones is profound, with half of the people in homeless shelters and prisons suffering from mental or substance use disorders..
</p>
<!--- section-8 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-8">8. Challenges in Mental Health Treatment</span>
<p>
    Treatment for mental disorders can be vitally important, reducing suffering, preventing disability, and restoring individuals' dreams and potential. Successful treatment can improve quality of life, as demonstrated in the story of John, a thirty-six-year-old engineer whose severe depression following a failed marriage was alleviated through a combination of medication and psychotherapy. However, treatment doesn't always work for everyone, with depression remaining one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated mental disorders in the United States. An estimated 21 million adults experienced at least one depressive episode in 2020, with about 66% receiving some form of treatment. Despite these efforts, the rate of success is not uniform, indicating the need for continued research and innovation in mental health treatment..

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-9">9. The Limitations of Depression Treatment</span>
<p>
    Depression, one of the most commonly diagnosed mental disorders, is often considered treatable with a combination of medication and psychotherapy. However, a twelve-year study that followed 431 people with depression revealed that 90% had persistent symptoms. The average rate of symptoms over the twelve-year period was 59%, indicating that depression is a chronic but episodic illness. These patients experienced fluctuating symptoms, with some periods of remission followed by relapses, even with treatment and medication. Furthermore, only about 66% of individuals who experience depressive episodes receive some form of treatment. This inconsistency in treatment success reflects the complex nature of depression and underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach to mental health care.
</p>
<!--- section-10 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-10">10. Challenges in Treating Mental Disorders</span>
<p>
    While treatment success stories like John's offer hope, they are not representative of all cases. Many individuals with mental health disorders face significant challenges in finding effective treatments. The inconsistency in treatment outcomes can lead to frustration and disappointment, with some patients believing they are not receiving the correct diagnosis or the right medication. The term "treatment-resistant depression" is often used for cases where treatment does not yield the desired results, adding to the stigma associated with these conditions. This inconsistency in treatment success extends to other mental disorders such as OCD, autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. These conditions are often lifelong, requiring ongoing management rather than a one-time cure. This chronic nature of many mental disorders can discourage patients from seeking treatment, potentially leading to further stigmatization.

<!--- section-11 --->
<span class="subheading-text" id="section-11">11. Recognizing Mental Illness as a Global Health Emergency</span>
<p>
    Given the challenges in treating mental disorders, it's evident that mental illness has become a global health emergency. Despite significant investments in mental health research, the outcomes have not met expectations. In 2019, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) spent $3.2 billion on mental health research, but the former director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Dr. Tom Insel, noted that these efforts had little impact on reducing suicide, hospitalizations, or improving recovery rates for individuals with mental illness. This acknowledgment points to a critical gap in our understanding of mental illness and the need for more effective solutions. The key question that remains unanswered is, "What causes mental illness?" Without a clear understanding of the root causes, finding effective treatments and reducing the burden of mental disorders will continue to be challenging.
