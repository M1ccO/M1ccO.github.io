<span class="subheading-text" id="section-1">1. Impact of Diet on Mental Health and Metabolism</span>
<p>
    Diet profoundly impacts both physical and mental health. While its role in obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases is well-known, its influence on mental health and brain function is often underestimated. Nutritional psychiatry explores the intricate connections between diet, metabolism, and mental health. Diet affects neural circuits in the brain, which are responsible for appetite, eating behaviors, and even addiction to substances like tobacco and alcohol. For instance, the neural circuits for loneliness overlap with those for starvation. Chronic social isolation in fruit flies led to increased eating and decreased sleep, showing how a social problem can influence physical behaviors. Stimulating the neural circuit for social isolation caused flies to eat more and sleep less. Additionally, specific GABA and serotonin neural circuits are involved in both obesity and mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. This bidirectional relationship highlights the complexity of how diet and mental health influence each other. Metabolic processes affect mental states, and mental states, in turn, impact metabolism.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-2">2. Role of Vitamins and Nutrients</span>
<p>
    Vitamins and nutrients are crucial for maintaining mental and neurological health. Deficiencies in vitamins like thiamine, folate, and vitamin B12 can cause a range of mental and neurological disorders, including depression, apathy, irritability, confusion, memory impairment, sleep disturbances, fatigue, hallucinations, and delusions. These vitamins are essential for energy metabolism within mitochondria, and deficiencies lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Correcting these deficiencies can sometimes completely resolve mental health issues, making it one of the few clear-cut cases in psychiatry where a simple treatment can address a specific problem. It is essential to check these vitamin levels in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders to identify and treat deficiencies effectively. Vitamin deficiencies in pregnant women can result in developmental abnormalities in their children, highlighting the critical role of mitochondria in development. While other vitamins and nutrients are connected to mitochondrial function, thiamine, folate, and vitamin B12 are particularly significant due to their direct impact on mental and physical health.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-3">3. Effects of Food Quality</span>
<p>
    The food supply has changed dramatically over the past fifty years, significantly affecting human metabolism and mental health. Genetically modified plants, antibiotic and hormone-laden livestock, and highly processed foods are now common. These changes have led to a food supply often lacking essential nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Junk food is devoid of nutritional value and contains artificial ingredients linked to poor metabolic health. Three dietary factors directly related to mitochondrial function and mental health are trans fatty acids (TFAs), fiber, and high blood glucose levels. TFAs, once marketed as healthier alternatives to saturated fats, are now recognized as toxic. They have been banned in the US due to their association with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, depression, aggression, irritability, and Alzheimer’s disease. In one study, pregnant and lactating rats given TFAs produced offspring with greater anxiety, higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), greater inflammation, and reduced glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus. Fiber benefits metabolic health by converting to butyrate by gut microbes, which serves as a primary fuel source for mitochondria in gut cells and plays a role in liver cells. High blood glucose levels impair mitochondria and brain function, especially in people with diabetes. For instance, diabetic rats with high glucose levels showed decreased ATP production, increased oxidative stress, and decreased antioxidant capacities. In humans, high blood glucose impairs processing speed, memory, and attention, and increases sadness and anxiety. Elevated blood glucose may contribute to higher rates of depression and Alzheimer’s disease in people with diabetes.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-4">4. Obesity and Its Complexities</span>
<p>
    Obesity involves both increased calorie intake and reduced calorie burning. Obesity and mental disorders share neural circuits related to appetite and feeding behaviors, leading to interconnected issues like depression, anxiety, loneliness, and sleep disturbances. Obesity is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which can exacerbate mental disorders, creating a vicious cycle. Obese individuals with mental disorders may experience more severe symptoms and weight gain. Insulin resistance, common in obesity, impacts mitochondrial function and brain health. Insulin resistance leads to higher insulin levels, driving hunger and weight gain, and inhibiting mitochondrial biogenesis, further complicating metabolic health. Studies show how insulin signaling affects mitochondrial response to stress. For example, insulin-resistant mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) showed impairment in mitochondrial stress response. When given intranasal insulin, their mitochondria responded normally, and they gained less weight. Mitochondria play a key role in how the brain and body respond to high-calorie foods and obesity. Another study found that microglial cells in the brains of HFD-fed mice caused brain inflammation before weight gain, driven by mitochondrial changes. Deleting a specific mitochondrial protein (UCP2) in these mice prevented brain inflammation and obesity. This suggests mitochondria are crucial in regulating feeding behaviors, obesity, and leptin resistance.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-5">5. Fasting, Starvation, and Eating Disorders</span>
<p>
    Fasting, the practice of abstaining from food for a period, can lead to significant changes in metabolism and mitochondrial function. While often perceived negatively, fasting can have profound benefits for the human body. For adults, intermittent fasting or extended periods without food can promote autophagy—a process where cells break down and recycle damaged components, leading to cellular rejuvenation. Mitochondria adapt during fasting by forming long tubular networks to maintain ATP production and protect against degradation. However, prolonged fasting can turn into starvation, triggering adverse effects. Starvation lowers metabolism, slows heart rate, decreases body temperature, and causes mental symptoms such as irritability, depression, and hypomania. The Minnesota Starvation Experiment illustrated these effects, where men subjected to semi-starvation diets exhibited severe mental symptoms, including depression, anxiety, fatigue, and obsessive behaviors. Upon refeeding, some developed binge eating and body image concerns, highlighting the complex relationship between starvation and mental health. Eating disorders often stem from societal pressures or preexisting vulnerabilities, leading to metabolic disturbances that impact brain function. For example, young women pressured to be thin for ballet may starve themselves, initiating a cycle of metabolic and mental disturbances, including distorted body image and severe mental health issues.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-6">6. The Gut-Brain Axis and the Microbiome</span>
<p>
    The intestinal tract plays a significant role in both metabolic and mental health, with a growing body of research exploring this connection. The gut microbiome—trillions of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the digestive tract—affects overall health, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Animal studies show that gut microbes can influence weight gain; for instance, the microbiome of obese mice extracts more calories from food than that of thin mice. When transferred to thin mice, the obese microbiome causes weight gain. The gut microbiome also impacts mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders. Gut bacteria produce metabolites, neurotransmitters, and hormones that enter the bloodstream and influence metabolism and brain function. Additionally, the cells lining the intestinal tract produce hormones and neuropeptides that affect the brain and metabolism. The gut's nervous system, particularly the vagus nerve, communicates directly with the brain. About 90% of the body's serotonin is produced in the intestinal tract. Gut microbes send signals to mitochondria in gut and immune cells, altering mitochondrial metabolism, gut barrier function, and inflammation. This complex communication network highlights the significant role of the gut-brain axis in health and disease.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-7">7. Food, Fasting, and the Gut Microbiome as Treatments</span>
<p>
    Dietary interventions can address mental symptoms through various mechanisms. Correcting nutritional deficiencies, removing dietary allergens or toxins, and adopting healthy diets like the Mediterranean diet can improve mental and metabolic health. Fasting, intermittent fasting (IF), and fasting-mimicking diets stimulate autophagy and mitophagy, enhancing metabolic health. Improving the gut microbiome through diet and potentially probiotics or fecal microbial transplants is also important. Nutritional deficiencies such as folate, vitamin B12, and thiamine deficiency must be identified and corrected. Excessive use of vitamins and supplements can cause metabolic problems, so a balanced approach is essential. Specific nutraceuticals, including L-methylfolate, Vitamin B12, SAMe, and N-acetylcysteine, may improve mitochondrial function. However, excessive reliance on supplements is not a cure-all; dietary interventions, good sleep, stress reduction, and exercise play crucial roles in improving mitochondrial health. The Mediterranean diet (MD) has been linked to lower rates of depression and cognitive impairment. In one trial, 32% of people following the MD achieved remission of depression compared to 8% in a control group. This diet's benefits on brain mitochondrial function and overall metabolic health suggest its potential in treating mental health disorders.

<p>
    Addressing vitamin and nutritional deficiencies is crucial for maintaining metabolic and mental health. While taking a large number of vitamins and supplements may seem beneficial, it can sometimes cause more harm than good by disrupting metabolic balance. Vitamins and supplements such as L-methylfolate, Vitamin B12, SAMe, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), L-tryptophan, zinc, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, and others are potential aids in improving mitochondrial function. For example, a study involving 180 patients with bipolar depression tested three treatments: a "mitochondrial cocktail," NAC alone, and a placebo. The mitochondrial cocktail included a wide array of vitamins and supplements. Surprisingly, the study found no significant difference among the groups, suggesting that low levels of these vitamins might be a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction rather than the cause. This highlights the importance of addressing underlying metabolic issues through balanced approaches, including dietary interventions, stress reduction, sleep improvement, and exercise, rather than solely relying on supplements.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-9">9. Diet and Fasting</span>
<p>
    Adhering to diets like the Mediterranean diet (MD) can significantly impact mental health. For instance, a trial called the SMILES trial randomized 67 people with major depression to follow either the MD or a social support group. After twelve weeks, 32% of those following the MD achieved remission compared to only 8% in the control group. This suggests the diet's potential in treating depression. Further research on monkeys showed that those fed a Western diet had diminished bioenergetic patterns in brain regions, correlating with insulin and glucose levels. In contrast, monkeys on the MD maintained normal mitochondrial function in brain regions. Fasting, intermittent fasting (IF), and fasting-mimicking diets can also promote brain health by producing ketone bodies, which serve as an alternative energy source for insulin-resistant brain cells and stimulate autophagy. IF has shown to improve mood, cognition, and protect neurons in animal models. Researchers found that IF increased GABA activity in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in depression, anxiety, and memory disorders. This increase in GABA activity was linked to improved mitochondrial function, highlighting mitochondria's critical role in brain health.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-10">10. The Ketogenic Diet and Its Impact</span>
<p>
    The ketogenic diet, high in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates, has shown profound effects on brain health, particularly in treating epilepsy. Developed in 1921 to mimic the fasting state without causing starvation, the diet reduces or stops seizures in about 85% of those who try it. Despite its fall from favor due to the advent of antiepileptic medications, the ketogenic diet resurfaced in the 1970s for treatment-resistant epilepsy. Clinical trials and a 2020 Cochrane Review confirmed its efficacy, with children on the diet being three times more likely to achieve seizure freedom and six times more likely to experience a significant reduction in seizures compared to those receiving usual care. The ketogenic diet improves brain function by providing an alternative fuel source, altering neurotransmitter levels, regulating calcium channels, decreasing inflammation, improving the gut microbiome, increasing metabolic rate, reducing insulin resistance, and inducing both mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. These effects can lead to long-term healing, with many people maintaining their well-being after stopping the diet. Early research suggests the diet's potential in treating mental health disorders, with some patients achieving full remission of symptoms. For example, in a trial with Alzheimer's disease patients, those on the ketogenic diet showed improved daily function and quality of life, demonstrating the diet's broader therapeutic potential.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-11">11. The Gut Microbiome</span>
<p>
    The gut microbiome plays a significant role in mental and metabolic health. Comprising trillions of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, the gut microbiome influences obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. For instance, studies show that the gut microbiome in obese mice extracts more calories from food compared to thin mice. When the obese microbiome is transferred to thin mice, they gain weight, demonstrating the microbiome's impact on metabolism. Additionally, the gut microbiome affects mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders. It also influences neurodegenerative disorders and epilepsy. Gut bacteria produce metabolites, neurotransmitters, and hormones that enter the bloodstream and impact brain function. The gut also produces hormones and neuropeptides that affect the brain and metabolism. The vagus nerve plays a critical role in gut-brain communication, with about 90% of the body’s serotonin produced in the intestinal tract. Signals from gut microbes directly alter mitochondrial metabolism, affect gut barrier function, and can lead to inflammation, further emphasizing the interconnectedness of the gut and brain.

    Dietary interventions can address mental symptoms through various mechanisms. These include correcting nutritional deficiencies, removing dietary allergens or toxins, and adopting healthy diets like the Mediterranean diet. Fasting, intermittent fasting (IF), and fasting-mimicking diets stimulate autophagy and mitophagy, enhancing metabolic health. Improving the gut microbiome through diet and potentially probiotics or fecal microbial transplants is also important. While probiotics may play a role for some people, the field is still in its infancy, and the evidence is not yet conclusive. Avoiding antibiotic exposure when possible is crucial as antibiotics disrupt the microbiome and can cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Eating a diet rich in fiber and real, whole foods supports a healthy microbiome. Although probiotics show promise, they are not yet proven to significantly improve metabolism or mental health. Current research is exploring fecal microbial transplants as a treatment, but this approach remains experimental.

<span class="subheading-text" id="section-12">12. Success Story: Mildred—It’s Never Too Late!</span>
<p>
    Mildred's story illustrates the potential of dietary interventions to transform mental health. Mildred experienced a traumatic childhood and suffered from symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. At seventeen, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia, experiencing daily hallucinations and delusions. Over the years, she tried various antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing medications with little success. By seventy, she was obese, weighing 330 pounds, and had a court-appointed guardian due to her inability to care for herself. In a bid to lose weight, Mildred joined a weight-loss clinic at Duke University, which recommended the ketogenic diet. Within two weeks, she noticed significant improvements in her psychotic symptoms. For the first time in years, she could hear birds singing, as the voices in her head subsided. Her mood improved, and she began to have hope. Over time, she tapered off all psychiatric medications and lost 150 pounds, maintaining the weight loss. Thirteen years later, she remains symptom-free, medication-free, and without a guardian. Mildred's story is a testament to the ketogenic diet's potential to dramatically improve mental health, offering hope for others suffering from severe mental disorders. Her experience exemplifies the transformative power of addressing metabolic health through dietary changes.
