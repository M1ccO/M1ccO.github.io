Chapter 67
Spiridon

ROUNDHEADED SPIRIDON, on whose face only a practiced eye could
distinguish respect from mockery, had aroused Nerzhin’s interest as soon as
he arrived in the sharashka. There had been carpenters and mechanics and
turners there before him, but Spiridon’s unspoiled naturalness made him
different. Here, without a doubt, was a representative of the People on
whose wisdom Nerzhin could draw.
He felt, however, a certain awkwardness. He could find no excuse for
getting to know Spiridon more closely. He had at first nothing to talk to him
about, they did not meet at work, and they lived in different parts of the
prison. The small group of manual laborers lived in a separate room and
spent their leisure hours apart from other prisoners, so that, when Nerzhin
started visiting Spiridon, they all, Spiridon among them, decided that he
was a wolf on the prowl, seeking prey for the godfather.
Spiridon considered himself the least important person in the sharashka
and could not imagine why operations officers should be targeting him, but
since they turned up their noses at no carrion, he had to be on his guard.
When Nerzhin came into the room, Spiridon would light up with pretended
joy, make room for him on the bunk, and with a stupid look on his face start
talking about something a million miles from politics: how to catch a
spawning fish with a spike or catch it by the gills with a forked stick in still
water or lure it into a net; how he had hunted “elk and brown bears” (but
better steer clear of “the black bear with a white tie”!); how lungwort is
used to get rid of snakes, while the “woodpecker herb” is “mighty good for
mowing.” Then there was the long story of his courtship of Marfa
Ustinovna in the twenties, when she belonged to the drama group at the
village club; her parents wanted to marry her off to a rich miller, but she
loved Spiridon and eloped with him, and they were secretly married on St.
Peter’s day.

While Spiridon was telling him all this, those sore eyes hardly moved.
They seemed to say from under his bushy ginger eyebrows, “Why do you
keep coming here, wolf? You can see for yourself you’ll get slim pickings.”
In fact, any stoolie would have despaired long ago and abandoned this
uncooperative victim. Nobody could have been so curious about Spiridon’s
hunting career as to come along and listen patiently to his revelations every
Sunday evening.
But Nerzhin, who, to begin with, felt shy when he looked in on Spiridon,
was also the Nerzhin with an insatiable longing to solve here in prison
problems he had not thought through as a free man. He kept it up month
after month and, far from wearying of Spiridon’s stories, felt refreshed by
them; they were like the breath of a river at dawn, like the breeze that
freshens a field in the afternoon, and they took him back to that unique
seven years in the life of Russia, the seven years of the New Economic
Policy, the equal and the like of which Russia had never known from the
time of the first clearings in the primeval forest, long before the coming of
Rurik’s men, to the most recent “dis-amalgamation” of collective farms.
Nerzhin had caught a glimpse of that time while he was still too young to
understand, and he greatly regretted not having been born a bit earlier.
Abandoning himself to Spiridon’s warm, husky voice, Nerzhin never once
tried to trick him into talking about politics. So Spiridon gradually began to
trust him and plunged into the past without being forced to it. He was no
longer inhibited by constant wariness, the deep furrows in his brow
disappeared, and a quiet smile played on his ruddy face.
Only his impaired eyesight prevented Spiridon from reading in the
sharashka. Occasionally, in an attempt to adapt his own speech to
Nerzhin’s, he would work in words such as “principle,” “period,” and
“analogously,” usually in the wrong place. In the days when Marfa
Ustinovna had performed with the village drama circle, he had heard the
name “Yesenin” from the stage, and it had remained in his memory.
“Yesenin?” Nerzhin said in surprise. “Great stuff! I’ve got his poems here
in the sharashka. They’re hard to come by nowadays.” And he took along
the little book in a jacket carpeted with embossed autumn maple leaves.
Could it be that a miracle was about to happen? he wondered. Would the
semiliterate Spiridon understand Yesenin?

No miracle took place. Spiridon didn’t remember a line of what he had
heard. But he greatly enjoyed “Tanyusha Was Oh, So Pretty” and
“Threshing.”
Two days later Major Shikin called Nerzhin in and ordered him to hand
over Yesenin for censorial inspection. Nerzhin never discovered who had
informed on him. But now that he had clearly been victimized by the
godfather and lost his Yesenin, more or less because of Spiridon, Gleb was
finally seen to be trustworthy. Spiridon began to talk to him as an equal and
a friend, and their conversations no longer took place in the room but under
the stairs inside the main prison building, where nobody could hear them.
On the last five or six Sunday evenings, Spiridon’s stories had given
Nerzhin glimpses of the profundity for which he had longed. The life of a
Russian peasant, indistinguishable from millions of others, who had been
seventeen in the year of the Revolution and just over forty when the war
with Hitler began, unfolded before Nerzhin’s eyes.
Hurricanes had raged around him. He had become head of the family at
fourteen (his father was called up for the war with Germany and killed in
action) and had gone out to mow with the old men. (“I learned to use a
scythe in half a day.”) At sixteen he was employed in a glassworks and
marching to open-air meetings under red banners when it was announced
that the land now belonged to the peasants. Spiridon rushed back to his
village and took a plot. That year he and his mother, younger brother, and
sisters strained every sinew, and by the Feast of the Protectress, they had
corn for the winter. But after Christmas the authorities started forcibly
exacting all the grain they could for the towns: Come on, hand it over,
more, more, more. Then after Easter, Spiridon’s year was called up—the
eighteens, and he’d just turned nineteen. The Red Army was about to grab
him. But Spiridon saw no advantage in leaving his land for the army, so he
and some of the other village lads took off into the woods and became
“Greens” (“Leave us alone and we’ll leave you alone”). Later on, though, it
wasn’t safe even out in the woods. So they went over to the Whites, who
had popped up briefly in their district. The Whites interrogated them,
wanted to know if there was a commissar among them. There was no
commissar, so the Whites knocked the ringleader on the head to encourage
the others, made them wear tricolor cockades, and gave them rifles. The
Whites generally did things in the old way, as under the tsar. After they’d

fought for the Whites a bit, Spiridon and his comrades were taken prisoner
by the Reds. (They didn’t put up much resistance; in fact, they gave
themselves up.)
The Reds shot the officers and ordered the rankers to remove the
cockades from their caps and put on armbands. Spiridon remained with the
Reds till the end of the Civil War. He had fought in Poland, too, and after
that his unit had become part of the Labor Army. He had thought he would
never get home. Then at Shrovetide they were taken to Petersburg and in
the first week of Lent marched across the sea over the ice to capture some
fortress. Only then did Spiridon manage to get home.
He returned to his village in the spring and eagerly set to work on the
patch of land he had fought to make his own. Others came back from the
war work-shy and all talk, but not Spiridon. He quickly put his holding on a
firm footing (“A good husbandman can walk down the yard and pick up a
ruble”), married, and got himself some horses.
The government itself was of two minds at the time. It looked to the
poorer peasants for support, but nobody wanted to join the ranks of the
poor. Those peasants who liked work were eager to better themselves. A
new word was borne in on the breeze: “intensifier.” It meant anyone who
wanted to get the best out of his farm without hired labor, relying on science
and native wit. With his wife’s help, Spiridon Yegorov became an
“intensifier.”
“A good wife makes all the difference in life,” Spiridon always said.
Marfa Ustinovna was the joy of his life; marrying her was the luckiest thing
he ever did. Because of her he did not drink and hang around with idlers.
She had borne him three children in successive years, two sons and then a
daughter, but still pulled her weight, side by side with her husband, and
their holding had flourished. She was literate; she read a magazine called Be
Your Own Agronomist, and that was how Spiridon became an “intensifier.”
Intensifiers were made a fuss over; Spiridon and Marfa were given
subsidies and seed. They went from strength to strength, from well-off to
better-off, and began to think of building themselves a brick house, not
knowing that their good fortune was about to run out. Spiridon was
generally respected; he sat on the platform at meetings as a Civil War hero
and by now a Party member.

At that point, their home was completely destroyed by fire; they barely
managed to rescue the children. They were left with nothing.
But they were given little time to grieve. They had scarcely begun to
struggle to their feet after the fire when a thunderclap came from distant
Moscow. The “intensifiers,” unthinkingly fostered by Moscow, were now
just as unthinkingly rechristened “kulaks” and weeded out. Marfa and
Spiridon were glad that they had not got around to building their brick
house.
Fate had played one of its favorite tricks, and their misfortune proved to
be a blessing.
Spiridon Yegorov might easily have been marched off by the GPU to die
in the tundra, but instead he was appointed commissar for collectivization
to herd the people into collective farms. He took to wearing a minatory
revolver on his hip, personally evicted people from their houses, and sent
them off under police escort, empty-handed, without belongings, kulaks and
nonkulaks alike.
Spiridon’s behavior at this and at other critical moments in his career
defied easy explanation or class analysis. Nerzhin did not reproach him, not
wanting to reopen old wounds, and anyway it was easy to see that all this
had left Spiridon troubled at heart. He had started drinking—and drank as
though the whole village had once been his—and now he was messing up
everything. He had accepted the rank of commissar but neglected his duties.
He turned a blind eye to the peasants who killed off their beasts and entered
the kolkhoz without hoof or horn to their name.
For all this, Spiridon was dismissed, and they did not stop at that; he was
ordered to put his hands behind his back, and two militiamen, one behind
and one in front, revolvers drawn, marched him off to jail. He was tried
quickly (“In our whole pe-ri-od they’ve never wasted time trying people”),
given ten years for “economic counterevolution,” and sent off to the White
Sea Canal and, after that was finished, to the Moscow-Volga Canal. There
Spiridon worked at times as a manual laborer and at times as a carpenter.
He got good rations, and it was only for Marfa, left behind with their three
children, that his heart ached.
But then Spiridon’s case was reopened. The charge of “economic
counterrevolution” was changed to “dereliction of duty,” and as a result he
became a “class ally” instead of a “class enemy.” He was called in and

informed that he would now be entrusted with a rifle to stand guard over his
fellow prisoners. Only yesterday Spiridon, like any decent zek, had abused
the escort troops with the vilest of language and the convicts among them
with words even stronger, but he now took the proffered rifle and marched
out his comrades of yesterday under escort, because this shortened the term
of his imprisonment and gave him forty rubles a month to send home.
Before long, the camp commandant was congratulating him on his
release. Spiridon got his documents made out, not for a kolkhoz but for a
factory at Pochep. He collected Marfa and the children and was soon
appearing on the factory honors board as one of the best glassblowers. He
did all the overtime he could to recoup his losses from the fire. Husband
and wife began to think about a little cottage with a garden and further
schooling for their children. The children were fifteen, fourteen, and
thirteen when the war broke out. The front moved quickly toward the
settlement in which they lived. The authorities evacuated everybody they
could to the East, the whole population of Pochep included.
At every turning point in Spiridon’s life story, Nerzhin awaited the next
surprise with bated breath. He half expected to hear that Spiridon, resenting
as he must his years in camp, had stayed behind to await the Germans. Not
at all. Spiridon had behaved at first as people do in the best patriotic novels:
He buried his belongings, and as soon as the factory equipment was
evacuated by rail and the workers given carts, he put his wife and three
children on one of them and—“It isn’t my horse and it isn’t my whip, so off
we go and I’ll never say ‘whoa’ ”—retreated from Pochep all the way to
Kaluga, with thousands of others.
But near Kaluga something went wrong, and their column broke up.
There were now only hundreds of them rather than thousands. Moreover,
the men were to be enlisted at the first recruiting office along the route and
their families sent on without them.
As soon as it became clear that he faced separation from his family, sure
as ever that he was doing the right thing, Spiridon took to the woods, waited
till the front had rolled past, put his family on the same old cart, pulled by
the same horse, except that it was no longer state property but his very own
to keep, and took them all the way back to Pochep and from there to his
native village, where he settled in a deserted hut. He was told to take as
much of the former kolkhoz land as he could work—and to work it.

Spiridon plowed and sowed with no qualms of conscience, ignoring the war
bulletins, working steadily and confidently, as though he was back in the
far-off years when there was no kolkhoz and no war.
Partisans came to him and said, “Pull yourself together, Spiridon; you
should be fighting, not plowing.” “Somebody has to plow,” Spiridon
answered and refused to leave the land. They tried to force people to join
the Partisans. As he explained it now, it wasn’t enough that young and old
would just as soon be creeping up on the Germans, knife between teeth, as
sit at home chewing their crusts; no, what happened was that instructors
from Moscow were parachuted in to drive the peasants out with threats or
fatally compromise them.
The Partisans managed to kill a German dispatch rider right in the middle
of the village. They knew the German rules. The Germans drove in
immediately, turned the people out of their houses, and burned the whole
village to the ground.
Once again Spiridon did not hesitate. The time had come to settle
accounts with the Germans. He took Marfa and the children to her mother
and hurried off to join the same group of Partisans in the forest. He was
given an automatic rifle and, working just as conscientiously and
methodically as he had in the factory and on the land, he picked off
Germans patrolling the railway line, attacked convoys, helped to blow up
bridges, and visited his family at holiday times. In spite of everything, he
still had his family.
But the front was rolling back their way. They flattered themselves that
Spiridon would get a Partisan medal when Soviet troops arrived. It was
even announced that Partisans would be incorporated into the regular army
and that their days in the forest would soon be over.
Then a lad came running with the news that the Germans had moved all
the inhabitants from the village where Marfa was living.
Spiridon was not waiting for the Red Army or for anything else. Without
a word to anyone, he abandoned his gun and his two drums of ammunition
and rushed off to find his family. He merged with the flood of displaced
people, pretending to be a civilian, walking beside the same old cart,
flicking the same little horse with his whip. Sure as always that he was
doing what was right and proper, he trudged along the congested road from
Pochep to Slutsk.

Nerzhin clutched his head and rocked from side to side.
“Dear oh dear oh dear! What extraordinary things you tell me, Spiridon
Danilych! I can’t take it all in. You went over the ice to Kronstadt; you were
one of those who set up this Soviet regime of ours; you forced people into
the collective farms. . . .”
“Well, didn’t you help to set it up?”
Nerzhin was at a loss for an answer. The conventional view was that his
father’s generation had established the regime and that in 1917, at that
solemn moment, every one of those heroes clearly realized what he was
doing.
The smile on Spiridon’s lips grew broader.
“You helped set it up, all right. Didn’t you realize?”
“No, I didn’t,” Nerzhin whispered, going over in his mind his three years
as an officer at the front.
“Well, it’s like that sometimes; we plant rye, and what comes up is
goosegrass.”
But Nerzhin wanted to get on with his sociological investigation.
“What happened next, Spiridon Danilych?”
What happened next?!
He could, of course, have made a break for the forest yet again. He tried it
once, but there was a hair-raising encounter with bandits, and he narrowly
saved his daughter from them. So he stayed with the column. Besides, he
had begun to realize that the Soviet authorities would not believe him,
would remember that he hadn’t joined the Partisans right away and that he
had deserted. He decided that he might as well be hanged for a sheep as for
a lamb and went all the way to Slutsk. There they were put on trains and
given food coupons to last them as far as the Rhineland. At first, the
whisper went around that children could not be taken, and Spiridon started
looking for a chance to turn back. But everyone was accepted, so he
abandoned his horse and cart without a second thought and joined the train.
He and the two boys were assigned to a factory near Mainz, and his wife
and daughter were sent to work for farmers.
One day at the factory a German foreman struck Spiridon’s younger son.
Without stopping to think, Spiridon jumped up and threatened the foreman
with an ax. Under German law Spiridon could have been shot. But the

foreman calmed down, went up to the mutineer, and, as Spiridon now told
the story, said: “I myself—Vater, I you—verstehe.”
He did not report the matter, and Spiridon learned soon afterward that the
foreman had that very morning received notification of his son’s death in
Russia.
Remembering that foreman in the Rhineland, the case-hardened Spiridon
was not ashamed to wipe a tear away with his sleeve.
“Since then I’ve never been angry with the Germans. They burned my
house down and did all those other bad things, but that Vater wiped the slate
clean. He had a heart, that man! There’s another sort of German for you!”
That was one of the rare, the very rare, events to shake the redheaded
peasant’s dogged certainty that he was always right. Otherwise, through all
the difficult years, through all the cruel vicissitudes, self-doubt had never
unmanned Spiridon at the decisive moment. Spiridon Yegorov was
horrifyingly ignorant, his mind was closed to the highest creations of the
human spirit and human society, but his actions and decisions were marked
by a steady and unwavering common sense. For instance, knowing that the
Germans would have shot all the village dogs, he calmly buried the severed
head of a cow in light snow, something he would never have done
ordinarily. Needless to say, he had never studied geography or German, but
when they were digging trenches in Alsace and things started getting rough
(to top it all, the Americans were raining down bombs on them), he took his
older son and ran away. He couldn’t read German signs or ask anyone the
way. He lay low in the daytime and traveled only by night, over unknown
country, as the crow flies, avoiding roads, covered ninety kilometers, and
crept from house to house till he found the farm near Mainz where his wife
was working. There he and his son holed up in a bunker in the orchard until
the Americans arrived.
Spiridon had never been teased by any of the eternally unanswerable
questions—whether sensory perception supplies true knowledge, whether
we are capable of knowing “things in themselves.” He was sure that he saw,
smelled, and understood things without possibility of error.
Spiridon’s moral code was just as uncomplicated and quietly confident.
He spoke ill of no one. He never bore false witness. He used foul language
only when necessary. He killed only when at war. He had got into fights
only for his bride. He wouldn’t steal a crumb or a rag from any other

person, but he robbed the state whenever opportunity offered, with a cool
conviction that it was right. He had, as he said, “sampled a few women”
before his marriage—but didn’t the great Aleksandr Pushkin confess that he
found the commandment “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife” a
particularly hard one to keep?
And now, fifty years old, a prisoner, almost blind, and obviously doomed
to die right here in prison, Spiridon showed no inclination to play the saint,
to despond, to repent, or—least of all—to “reform.” He simply took his
busy broom in his hands and swept the yard from dawn to dusk, day in and
day out, in a life-and-death struggle against the commandant and the
operations officers.
Whoever the power holders were, Spiridon was always at odds with them.
What Spiridon loved was the land.
What Spiridon possessed was his family.
Concepts such as homeland, religion, and socialism, little used in ordinary
everyday conversation, might have been completely unknown to Spiridon.
His ears were deaf to them; he could not get his tongue around them.
To him, homeland meant family.
Religion meant family.
Even socialism meant family.
To all the disseminators of the rational and good and eternal, all the
writers who had called Spiridon and his like “God bearers” (though he was
unaware of it), the priests, the Social Democrats, the volunteer agitators and
professional propagandists, White landowners and Red kolkhoz chairmen
who had themselves dealt with Spiridon in the course of his life, he had just
one angry, but of necessity silent, message: “Why don’t you all go . . . !”
